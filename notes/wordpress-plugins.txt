This plugin simplifies the creation of graphically navigable WordPress sites, creating a list or tables of pages, posts, taxonomies, and custom post types, selected in a variety of ways. Highly customizable output using a variety of optional user-defined filters.
Sites with nested pages can show a table of clickable thumbnails of child pages, with size of the tables, and the number of rows, automatically computed to fit, based on the thumbnail sizes.
A table of posts selected by tag, category, or author can be displayed in the same manner.
Thumbnails of pictures, and the galleries of pictures added in each page, can be automatically resized either through a single default setting in the WordPress administration page, or by specifying a size in each page. Missing thumbnails will be automatically generated.
A gallery of images can be created simply by placing them in a new directory under the wp-content/uploads directory. Standard command-line or FTP tools can then be used to move, rename, or delete images.
Output and page/post selection is extensible through the use of filters.

Force Strong Passwords
The WordPress user profile includes a JavaScript-powered indicator as a guide to the strength of a password being entered. However, there is nothing to stop users entering weak passwords. Often, users changing their password to something very weak is the most vulnerable aspect of a WordPress installation.
Strong passwords are enforced for all users who have any of a specified array of capabilities. The default list is: publish_posts, upload_files, edit_published_posts (see Roles and Capabilities). If the user whose password is being edited holds any of these capabilities, the strong password enforcement will be triggered.
