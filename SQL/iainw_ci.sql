It\'s a great way to test your ideas before you write any code.','Chris Nodder','','',''),(210,'Lynda','2014-11-27','UX Design Techniques: Implementation Planning','User-centered design doesn\'t stop with visualization. In this, the final installment of UX Design Techniques, Chris Nodder shows how to gather the documentation you\'ve created so far and start planning the implementation of your design, from prioritizing features with the most business benefit to setting achievable metrics.','Chris Nodder','','',''),(211,'Lynda','2014-11-27','Foundations of UX: Accessibility','The Internet has removed many obstacles to communication and interaction. However, when websites, technologies, or tools are poorly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people with disabilities from using the web. In this course, you\'ll learn how accessibility lowers the barrier to entry, by providing equal access and opportunity to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive abilities. Derek Featherstone introduces the core concepts of accessibility as they apply to UX design, including an overview of the assistive technology visitors may use to access your projects. He includes practical examples, from re-creating visual interactions to writing great alternative text; introduces different personas and their unique challenges navigating the web; and shows how to make accessibility a regular part of your design workflow. Once you learn the foundations, you\'ll find that the benefits of accessibility - enhanced search, improved usability, and increased audience reach aid your designs almost as much as they aid your users.','Derek Featherstone','','',''),(212,'Lynda','2014-11-27','Foundations of UX: Usability Testing','Run your own basic usability study to find out just what your users need from your website, application, or device and learn where to focus design improvements to have the biggest impact. Author Chris Nodder shows how to design a study so that it answers your questions, recruit the right participants, and set up the test environment. The course also teaches you how to moderate and observe a usability session, interact with participants and ask the right kind of questions, and then analyze the results and share them with your team in a meaningful way.','Chris Nodder','','',''),(213,'Lynda','2014-11-27','Foundations of UX: Information Architecture','Improving the way the information in your site or application is organized and presented is one of the most cost-effective ways of increasing user satisfaction and engagement. Information architecture can help you find out how your users think about the world, and transition those lessons to your product. In this course, Chris Nodder teaches you how to perform card sort research to get information about user interactions, analyze the results, and create a validated information architecture plan. Then translate your plan into refined menus, content classification, and page layouts. Finally, test the success of your new structure with reverse card sorting and by monitoring feedback from server logs, site searches, and help desk calls.','Chris Nodder','','',''),(214,'Lynda','2014-12-05','Foundations of UX: Logic and Content','Foundations of UX: Logic and Content looks at how designers, developers, and content creators can use the ancient art of logic and reasoning to improve user experiences and facilitate communication. Morten Rand-Hendriksen looks at the principles of logic, how computer logic and human logic differ, and how these differences can be used to improve communication. The core idea of logic is to create a system in which communication is clear, precise, and unambiguous, which is (or at least should be) the goal of any website or other communication.','Morten Rand-Hendriksen','','',''),(215,'Lynda','2014-12-05','Responsive Media','Why restrict yourself to inline images and static text, especially in our multidevice, multiplatform era? Responsive media allows you to share more content with more people. Learn what you need to know to build image- and typography-rich pages (with HTML5 video!) that display correctly on a wide variety of devices. Christopher Schmitt will also show you how to convert fixed-width layouts into fluid grid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, use media queries to deliver custom design experiences, and prepare and retrieve PNG, JPEG, and SVG images so that they look their best.','Christopher Schmitt','','',''),(216,'Lynda','2014-12-05','Responsive Design Fundamentals','Web projects need to work across multiple devices, screen sizes, and browsing contexts. Web designs need to be responsive to these variables, providing an optimal viewing experience for each scenario. In this course, author James Williamson introduces responsive design to new web designers and fills in any gaps experienced designers may have, while providing a deeper exploration of how current trends in devices, connectivity, and user experience are driving its adoption. The course covers concepts like screen density, fluid grids, and responsive images, as well as actual design strategies that guide you from mock-up to testing.','James Williamson','','','');
