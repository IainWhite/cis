        <p>There are two statements named <strong>Linus's Law</strong>: one by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Eric S. Raymond', 'P'); ?> concerning software bug detection by a community, and the other by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linus Torvalds', 'P'); ?> about the motivations of programmers.</p>

        <h2>Eric Raymond</h2>
        <p>Linus's Law as described by Raymond is a claim about software development, named in honor of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linus Torvalds', 'P'); ?> and formulated by Raymond in his essay and book "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('The Cathedral and the Bazaar', 'B'); ?>" (1999).</p>
        <p>The law states that "<em>given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow</em>"; or more formally: "<em>Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to someone</em>".</p>
        <p>Presenting the code to multiple developers with the purpose of reaching consensus about its acceptance is a simple form of software reviewing.</p>
        <p>Researchers and practitioners have repeatedly shown the effectiveness of various types of reviewing process in finding bugs and security issues, and also that reviews may be more efficient than testing.</p>

        <h2>Linus Torvalds</h2>
        <p>In the book <strong>The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age</strong> (2001), Torvalds introduces his law in the prologue "<em>What Makes Hackers Tick? a.k.a. Linus's Law</em>", suggesting that every motivation that makes a person do something can be classified under "survival", "social life" or "entertainment".</p>
        <p>As a result, he writes, progress is defined as reaching a higher category; that is, not doing a thing merely for survival, but for social reasons, and then, even better, just for fun.</p>
