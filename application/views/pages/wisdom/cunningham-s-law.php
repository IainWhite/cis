        <p><strong>Cunningham's Law</strong> states "<em>the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer.</em>"</p>
        <p>The concept is named after <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ward Cunningham', '/people'); ?>, father of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('wiki', '/web-development'); ?>. According to Steven McGeady, the law's author, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wikipedia', '/web-development'); ?> may be the most well-known demonstration of this law.</p>
        <p>Cunningham's Law can be considered the Internet equivalent of the French saying "<em>Pr&ecirc;cher le faux pour savoir le vrai</em>" (Preach the falsehood to know the truth).</p>
