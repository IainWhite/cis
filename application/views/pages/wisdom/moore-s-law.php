        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline("Moore's Law"); ?>
        <p><strong>Moore's law</strong> is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years.</p>
        <p>The law is named after <strong>Gordon E. Moore</strong>, co-founder of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', '/companies'); ?> Corporation, who described the trend in his 1965 paper.</p>
        <p>His prediction has proven to be accurate, in part because the law is now used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development.</p>
        <p>The capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's law: processing speed, memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras.</p>
        <p>All of these are improving at roughly exponential rates as well.</p>
        <p>This exponential improvement has dramatically enhanced the impact of digital electronics in nearly every segment of the world economy.</p>
        <p>Moore's law describes a driving force of technological and social change in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> centuries.</p>
        <p>The period is often quoted as 18 months because of Intel executive <strong>David House</strong>, who predicted that chip performance would double every 18 months (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and their being faster).<p>
        <p>Although this trend has continued for more than half a century, Moore's law should be considered an observation or conjecture and not a physical or natural law.</p>
