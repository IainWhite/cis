        <p><strong>Parkinson's law</strong> is the adage that "<em>work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion</em>", and the title of a book which made it well known.</p>

        <p>Articulated by <strong>Cyril Northcote Parkinson</strong> as part of the first sentence of a humorous essay published in The Economist in 1955, it was reprinted with other essays in the book <strong>Parkinson's Law: The Pursuit of Progress</strong>. He derived the dictum from his extensive experience in the British Civil Service.</p>
        <p>A current form of the law is not the one Parkinson refers to by that name in the article, but a mathematical equation describing the rate at which bureaucracies expand over time. Much of the essay is dedicated to a summary of purportedly scientific observations supporting the law, such as the increase in the number of employees at the Colonial Office while Great Britain's overseas empire declined (he shows that it had its greatest number of staff when it was folded into the Foreign Office because of a lack of colonies to administer). He explains this growth by two forces: (1) "An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals" and (2) "Officials make work for each other." He notes that the number employed in a bureaucracy rose by 5-7% per year "irrespective of any variation in the amount of work (if any) to be done".</p>
        <p>In 1986, Alessandro Natta complained about the swelling bureaucracy in Italy. Mikhail Gorbachev responded that "Parkinson's law works everywhere".</p>

        <h2>Corollaries</h2>
        <p>The first referenced meaning of the law has dominated, and sprouted several corollaries, the best known being the Stockâ€“Sanford corollary to Parkinson's law:</p>
        <p><strong><em>If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute to do.</em></strong></p>
        <p>Other corollaries include Horstman's corollary to Parkinson's law:</p>
        <p><strong><em>Work contracts to fit in the time we give it.</em></strong></p>
        <p>as well as corollaries relating to computers, such as:</p>
        <p><strong><em>Data expands to fill the space available for storage.</em></strong></p>

        <h2>Generalization</h2>
        <p>The law could be generalized further as:</p>
        <p>The demand upon a resource tends to expand to match the supply of the resource.</p>
        <p>An extension is often added:</p>
        <p>The reverse is not true.</p>
        <p>This generalization has become very similar to the economic law of demand; the lower the price of a service or commodity, the greater the quantity demanded.</p>
        <p>Some define the law in regard to time as:</p>
        <p>The amount of time that one has to perform a task is the amount of time it will take to complete the task.</p>
