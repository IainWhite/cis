        <p><strong>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</strong> (<strong>IEEE</strong>, read as I Triple E) is a professional association with its Corporate Office in New York City and its Operations Center in Piscataway, New Jersey and is dedicated to advancing technological innovation and excellence. It has about 425,000 members in about 160 countries.</p>
        <p>The IEEE is incorporated under the Not for Profit Corporation Law of the state of New York in the United States.</p>
        <p>It was formed in 1963 by the merger of the <strong>Institute of Radio Engineers</strong> (IRE, founded 1912) and the <strong>American Institute of Electrical Engineers</strong> (AIEE, founded 1884).</p>
        <p>The major interests of the AIEE were wire communications (telegraphy and telephony) and light and power systems. The IRE concerned mostly radio engineering, and was formed from two smaller organizations, the Society of Wireless and Telegraph Engineers and the Wireless Institute. With the rise of electronics in the 1930s, electronics engineers usually became members of the IRE, but the applications of electron tube technology became so extensive that the technical boundaries differentiating the IRE and the AIEE became difficult to distinguish. After World War II, the two organizations became increasingly competitive, and in 1961, the leadership of both the IRE and the AIEE resolved to consolidate the two organizations. The two organizations formally merged as the IEEE on 1 January 1963.</p>
