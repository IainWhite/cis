        <p><strong>BlackBerry Limited</strong>, formerly known as <strong>Research In Motion Limited (RIM)</strong>, is a Canadian telecommunication and wireless equipment company best known to the general public as the developer of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BlackBerry', 'ITH'); ?> brand of smartphones and tablets, but also well known worldwide as a provider of secure & high reliability software for industrial applications and mobile device management (MDM). BlackBerry's software and hardware products are used worldwide by various government's agencies and by car makers and industrial plants throughout the world, much of this activity being unseen by the public. The company is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It was founded by <strong>Mike Lazaridis</strong> and <strong>Douglas Fregin</strong> in 1984. Mr. Fregin later left the company. In 1992 Mr. Lazaridis hired Jim Balsillie, and Mr. Lazaridis and Mr. Balsillie served as co-CEOs until 22 January 2012. In November 2013, John S. Chen took over as CEO. His strategy is to subcontract manufacturing to Foxconn, and to focus on software technology.</p>
        <p>Originally a dominant innovative company in the smartphone market for business and government usage, with 43% US market share in 2010, the company's dominance in the US smartphone market has in recent years declined precipitously, in part because of intense competition from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>. Due to such competition, the company's share in the US personal consumer market has now been reduced to 1.5% in April 2015.</p>
