        <p><strong>Netscape Communications</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Netscape Communications Corporation</strong> and commonly known as <strong>Netscape</strong>) is a US computer services company, best known for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Netscape Navigator', 'WB'); ?>, its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>When it was an independent company, its headquarters were in Mountain View, California.</p>
        <p>Netscape's web browser was once dominant in terms of usage share, but lost most of that share to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?> during the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('first browser war', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Netscape is credited with developing the Secure Sockets Layer Protocol <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SSL', 'IPA'); ?> for securing on-line communication, which is still widely used, as well as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?>, the most widely used language for client-side scripting of web pages.</p>
        <p>Netscape stock traded from 1995 until 1999 when it was acquired by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AOL', 'C'); ?> in a pooling-of-interests transaction ultimately worth US$10 billion.</p>
        <p>Shortly before its acquisition by AOL, Netscape released the source code for its browser and created the Mozilla Organization to coordinate future development of its product.</p>
        <p>The Mozilla Organization rewrote the entire browser's source code based on the Gecko rendering engine; all future Netscape releases were based on this rewritten code.</p>
        <p>The Gecko engine would later be used to power the Mozilla Foundation's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox', 'WB'); ?> browser.</p>
        <p>Under AOL, Netscape's browser development continued until December 2007, when Tom Drapeau, director of AOL's Netscape Brand, announced that the company would stop supporting Netscape software products as of 1 February 2008.</p>
