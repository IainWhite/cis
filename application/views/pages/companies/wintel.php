        <p><strong>WinTel</strong> is term that references a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC', 'ITH'); ?> built with an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> microprocessor and a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> OS.</p>
        <p>WinTel's architecture, which remains the dominant desktop and laptop platform, is commonly known as WinTel computing.</p>
        <p>By 1984, Microsoft experienced explosive growth and revenue from its disk operating system <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> sale to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> and other PC manufacturers.</p>
        <p>In 1987, IBM made disastrous manufacturing and marketing mistakes when the company manufactured non-<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM compatible PC', 'ITH'); ?>s, including the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PS/2', 'ITH'); ?> computer line.</p>
        <p>While other manufacturers made technological strides, IBM lost its leading position.</p>
        <p>By the early 1990s, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'c'); ?> excelled with central processing unit (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CPU', 'ITH'); ?>) and OS sales, while IBM suffered massive financial losses.</p>
        <p>Intel grew, and at one time it was the largest global manufacturer of motherboards and one of a few chipset manufacturers.</p>
