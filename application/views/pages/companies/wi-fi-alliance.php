        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Wi-Fi Alliance'); ?>
        <p><strong>Wi-Fi Alliance</strong> is a trade association that promotes <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi', 'ITN'); ?> technology and certifies Wi-Fi products if they conform to certain standards of interoperability.</p>
        <p>Not every <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IEEE', 'C'); ?> 802.11 compliant device is submitted for certification to the Wi-Fi Alliance, sometimes because of costs associated with the certification process.</p>
        <p>The lack of the Wi-Fi logo does not necessarily imply a device is incompatible with Wi-Fi devices.</p>
        <p>The Wi-Fi Alliance owns the Wi-Fi trademark. Manufacturers may use the trademark to brand certified products that have been tested for interoperability.</p>
