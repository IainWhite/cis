        <p><strong>Spyglass, Inc.</strong> was an Internet software company based in Champaign, Illinois.</p>
        <p>The company, founded in 1990, was an offshoot of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and created to commercialize and support technologies from the <strong>National Center for Supercomputing Applications (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NCSA', 'C'); ?>)</strong>.</p>
        <p>For several years, it focused on data visualization tools, such as graphing packages and 3D rendering engines.</p>
        <p>In May 1994, Spyglass licensed NCSA's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mosaic', 'WB'); ?> browser, with the intent to develop their own <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>However, NCSA's development effort had resulted in different features, user interfaces, and codebases for each of its major platforms: <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UNIX', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Spyglass therefore created its own Mosaic codebase in which most source code and all features were shared between platforms.</p>
        <p>Spyglass Mosaic's codebase was then licensed to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> and became the basis for their <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
