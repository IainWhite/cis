        <p><strong>Wang Laboratories</strong> was a computer company founded in 1951 by <strong>Dr. An Wang</strong> and <strong>Dr. G. Y. Chu</strong>. The company was successively headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1954 - 1963), Tewksbury, Massachusetts (1963 - 1976), and finally in Lowell, Massachusetts (1976 - 1997). At its peak in the 1980s, Wang Laboratories had annual revenues of $3 billion and employed over 33,000 people.</p>
        <p>The company was directed by Dr. Wang, who was described as an "<em>indispensable leader</em>" and played a personal role in setting business and product strategy until his death in 1990. Under his direction, the company went through several distinct transitions between different product lines.</p>
        <p>Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection in August 1992. After emerging from bankruptcy, the company eventually changed its name to <strong>Wang Global</strong>. Wang Global was acquired by <strong>Getronics</strong> of The Netherlands in 1999, becoming <strong>Getronics North America</strong>, then was sold to <strong>KPN</strong> in 2007 and <strong>CompuCom</strong> in 2008, after which it no longer existed as a distinct brand or division.</p>
