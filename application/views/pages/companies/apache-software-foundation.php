        <p><strong>The Apache Software Foundation</strong> (<strong>ASF</strong>) is an American non-profit corporation to support Apache software projects, including the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apache', 'WS'); ?> HTTP Server.</p>
        <p>The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated in Delaware, U.S., in June 1999.</p>
        <p>The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized community of developers.</p>
        <p>The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License and is therefore free and open source software (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FOSS', 'IT'); ?>).</p>
        <p>The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license.</p>
        <p>Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project.</p>
        <p>The ASF is a meritocracy, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects.</p>
