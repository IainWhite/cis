        <p><strong>CompuServe</strong> (<strong>CompuServe Information Service</strong>, also known by its acronym <strong>CIS</strong>) was the first major commercial online service in the United States. It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major player through the mid 1990s, when it was sidelined by the rise of services such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AOL', 'C'); ?> with monthly subscriptions rather than hourly rates. Since the purchase of CompuServe's Information Services Division by AOL, it has operated as an online service provider and an Internet service provider. The original CompuServe Information Service, later rebranded as CompuServe Classic, was shut down 1 July 2009. The newer version of the service, CompuServe 2000, continues to operate as an internet portal.</p>
