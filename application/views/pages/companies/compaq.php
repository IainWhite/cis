        <p><strong>Compaq Computer Corporation</strong> was a company founded in 1982, that developed, sold, and supported computers and related products and services.</p>
        <p>Compaq produced some of the first <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatible', 'ITH'); ?> computers, being the first company to legally reverse-engineer the IBM Personal Computer.</p>
        <p>It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Dell', 'C'); ?> in 2001.</p>
        <p>Struggling in the aftermath of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('dot-com bubble', 'WD'); ?> bust, Compaq was acquired for US$25 billion by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Hewlett-Packard', 'C'); ?> (HP) in 2002.</p>
        <p>The Compaq brand remains in use by HP for lower-end systems.</p>
