        <p><strong>Texas Instruments Inc</strong> is an American electronics company that designs and makes semiconductors, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. Headquartered at Dallas, Texas, United States, TI is the third largest manufacturer of semiconductors worldwide after <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Samsung', 'C'); ?>, the second largest supplier of chips for cellular handsets after <strong>Qualcomm</strong>, and the largest producer of digital signal processors (DSPs) and analog semiconductors, among a wide range of other semiconductor products, including calculators, microcontrollers and multi-core processors. Texas Instruments is among the Top 20 Semiconductor producing companies in the world.</p>
        <p>Texas Instruments was founded in 1951. It emerged after a reorganisation of <strong>Geophysical Service</strong>. This company manufactured equipment for use in the seismic industry as well as defence electronics. TI began research in transistors in the early 1950s and produced the world's first commercial silicon transistor. In 1954, Texas Instruments designed and manufactured the first transistor radio and <strong>Jack Kilby</strong> invented the integrated circuit in 1958 while working at TI's Central Research Labs. The company produced the first integrated circuit-based computer for the U.S. Air Force in 1961. TI researched infrared technology in the late 1950s and later made radar systems as well as guidance and control systems for both missiles and bombs. The hand-held calculator was introduced to the world by TI in 1967.</p>
        <p>In the 1970s and 80s the company focused on consumer electronics including digital clocks, watches, hand-held calculators, home computers as well as various sensors. In 1997, its defence business was sold to <strong>Raytheon</strong>. In 2007, Texas Instruments was awarded the Manufacturer of the Year for Global Supply Chain Excellence by World Trade magazine. Texas Instruments is considered to be one of the most ethical companies in the world.</p>
        <p>After the acquisition of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('National Semiconductor', 'C'); ?> in 2011, the company has a combined portfolio of nearly 45,000 analog products and customer design tools, making it the world's largest maker of analog technology components. In 2011, Texas Instruments ranked 175 in the Fortune 500. TI is made up of two main divisions: Semiconductors (SC) and Educational Technology (ET) of which Semiconductor products account for approximately 96% of TI's revenue.</p>
