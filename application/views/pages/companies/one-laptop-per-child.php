        <p><strong>One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)</strong> was setup to oversee the creation of affordable educational devices for use in the developing world.</p>
        <p>Its primary goal is the production and distribution of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OLPC XO', 'ITH'); ?>, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organisations such as AMD, Chi Mei, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel, Red Hat, and Quanta.</p>
        <p>The OLPC project has received criticism both specific to its mission and criticism that is typical of many such systems, such as support, ease-of-use, security, content-filtering and privacy issues. Officials in some countries have criticised the project for its appropriateness in terms of price, cultural emphasis and priority as compared to other basic needs of people in third-world settings.</p>
