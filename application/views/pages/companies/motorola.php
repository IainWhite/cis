        <p><strong>Motorola Inc.</strong> is one of the leading manufacturers of microprocessors.</p>
        <p>Until the early 1990s, Motorola microprocessors were used in all <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> computers and in many workstations.</p>
        <p>Following the development of its 68040 chip in 1989, however, Motorola changed its focus from the 680x0 line of CISC chips to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RISC', 'ITH'); ?> technologies.</p>
        <p>In 1993, Motorola joined <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Computer', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> in designing a new RISC architecture that would form the basis of the next generation of personal computers.</p>
        <p>This effort culminated in the introduction of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PowerPC', 'ITH'); ?> architecture in 1994.</p>
