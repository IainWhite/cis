        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('AIM'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>AIM</strong> alliance was an alliance formed on 2 October 1991, between <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola', 'C'); ?> to create a new computing standard based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PowerPC', 'ITH'); ?> architecture.</p>
        <p>The stated goal of the alliance was to challenge the dominant <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wintel', 'C'); ?> computing platform with a new computer design and a next-generation operating system.</p>
        <p>It was thought that the CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) processors from Intel were an evolutionary dead-end in microprocessor design, and that since <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RISC', 'ITH'); ?> was the future, the next few years were a period of great opportunity.</p>
        <p>The CPU was the PowerPC, a single-chip version of IBM's POWER1 CPU. Both IBM and Motorola would manufacture PowerPC chips for this new platform.</p>
        <p>The computer architecture base was called <strong>PReP</strong> (for <strong>P</strong>owerPC <strong>Re</strong>ference <strong>P</strong>latform), and later complemented with OpenFirmware and renamed <strong>CHRP</strong> (for <strong>C</strong>ommon <strong>H</strong>ardware <strong>R</strong>eference <strong>P</strong>latform).</p>
        <p>IBM used PReP and CHRP for PCI version of IBM's RS/6000 platform, from existing Micro Channel architecture models, and changed only to support the new 60x bus style of the PowerPC.</p>
