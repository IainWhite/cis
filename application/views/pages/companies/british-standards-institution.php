        <p>The <strong>BSI Group</strong>, also known in its home market as the <strong>British Standards Institution (BSI)</strong>, is a multinational business services provider whose principal activity is the production of standards and the supply of standards-related services.</p>
        <p>BSI Group was founded as the Engineering Standards Committee in London in 1901. It subsequently extended its standardisation work and became the British Engineering Standards Association in 1918, adopting the name British Standards Institution in 1931 after receiving its Royal Charter in 1929. In 1998 a revision of the Charter enabled the organisation to diversify and acquire other businesses, and the trading name was changed to BSI Group.</p>
        <p>The Group now operates internationally in 172 countries. The core business remains standards and standards related services, although the majority of the Group's revenue comes from management systems assessment and certification work.</p>
