        <p>The <strong>Free Software Foundation (FSF)</strong> is a non-profit organisation founded by <strong>Richard Stallman</strong> on 4 October 1985 to support the free software movement, which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify computer software, with the organisation's preference for software being distributed under <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('copyleft', 'LIC'); ?> ("share alike") terms, such as with its own <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNU General Public License', 'LIC'); ?>. The FSF was incorporated in Massachusetts, USA, where it is also based.</p>
        <p>From its founding until the mid-1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write free software for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNU Project', 'C'); ?>. Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community.</p>
