        <p><strong>Data General</strong> was one of the first minicomputer firms from the late 1960s. Three of the four founders were former employees of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Equipment Corporation', 'C'); ?>. Their first product, the <strong>Data General Nova</strong>, was a 16-bit minicomputer. This used their own operating system, <strong>RDOS</strong>, and in conjunction with programming languages like "<strong>Data General Business Basic</strong>" they provided a multi-user operating system with record locking and built-in databases far ahead of many contemporary systems. The Nova was followed by the <strong>Supernova</strong> and <strong>Eclipse</strong> product lines, all of which were used in many applications for the next two decades. The company employed an Original Equipment Manufacturer (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OEM', 'IT'); ?>) sales strategy to sell to third parties who incorporated Data General computers into the OEM's specific product lines. A series of missteps in the 1980s, including missing the advance of microcomputers despite the launch of the <strong>microNOVA</strong> in 1977, and the <strong>Data General-One</strong> portable computer in 1984, led to a decline in the company's market share. The company did continue into the 1990s, however, and was eventually acquired by <strong>EMC Corporation</strong> in 1999.</p>
