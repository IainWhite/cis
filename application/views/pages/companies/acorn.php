        <p><strong>Acorn Computers Ltd.</strong> was a British computer company established in Cambridge, England, in 1978.</p>
        <p>The company produced a number of computers which were especially popular in the UK. These included the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn Electron', 'ITH'); ?>, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Micro', 'IWH'); ?>, and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn Archimedes', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s. It is more known for its <strong>BBC Micro model B</strong> computer than for its other products.</p>
        <p>Though the company was broken up into several independent operations in 1998, its legacy includes the development of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RISC', 'ITH'); ?> personal computers.</p>
        <p>Acorn is sometimes referred to as the "<em>British Apple</em>" and has been compared to Fairchild Semiconductor for being a catalyst for start-ups.</p>
        <p>In 2010 the company was listed by David Meyer in ZDNet as number nine in a feature of top ten fallen "Dead IT giants".</p>
        <p>Many of Britain's IT professionals gained their early experiences on Acorns, which were often more technically advanced than commercially successful US hardware.</p>
