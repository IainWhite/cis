        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('NeXT'); ?>
        <p><strong>NeXT, Inc.</strong> (later <strong>NeXT Computer, Inc.</strong> and <strong>NeXT Software, Inc.</strong>) was an American computer company head-quartered in Redwood City, California, that developed and manufactured a series of computer workstations intended for the higher education and business markets.</p>
        <p>NeXT was founded in 1985 by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> Computer co-founder <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Jobs', 'P'); ?>, after he was forced out of Apple, along with a few of his co-workers.</p>
        <p>NeXT introduced the first <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NeXT', 'ITH'); ?> Computer in 1988, and the smaller NeXTstation in 1990.</p>
        <p>The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, its innovative object-oriented <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NextSTEP', 'OS'); ?> operating system and development environment were highly influential.</p>
