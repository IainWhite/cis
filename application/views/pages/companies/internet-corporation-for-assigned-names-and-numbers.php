        <p>The <strong>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</strong> (<strong>ICANN</strong>) is a nonprofit organization that coordinates the Internet's global domain name system.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Assigned Numbers Authority', 'C'); ?> (IANA) is a department of ICANN responsible for managing the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DNS', 'IPA'); ?> Root and the numbering system for IP addresses.</p>
        <p>ICANN was created on 18 September 1998, and incorporated on 30 September 1998. It is headquartered in the Playa Vista section of Los Angeles, California.</p>
        <p>ICANN is responsible for the coordination of maintenance and methodology of several databases of unique identifiers related to the namespaces of the Internet, and ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.</p>
        <p>The numbering facilities include the Internet Protocol address spaces (IPv4 and IPv6) and assignment of address blocks to regional Internet registries.</p>
        <p>ICANN maintains registries of Internet protocol identifiers, and the management of the top-level domain name space (DNS root zone), which includes the operation of root name servers.</p>
        <p>Most visibly, much of its work has concerned the DNS policy development for internationalization of the DNS system and introduction of new generic top-level domains (TLDs).</p>
        <p>ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the central Internet address pools and DNS root registries pursuant to the IANA function contract.</p>
        <p>ICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational stability of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global Internet community; and to develop policies appropriate to its mission through bottom-up, consensus-based processes.</p>
