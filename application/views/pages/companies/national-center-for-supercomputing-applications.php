        <p>The <strong>National Center for Supercomputing Applications</strong> (<strong>NCSA</strong>) is an American state-federal partnership to develop and deploy national-scale cyberinfrastructure that advances science and engineering.</p>
        <p>NCSA operates as a unit of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, although it provides high-performance computing resources to researchers across the US.</p>
        <p>Support for NCSA comes from the National Science Foundation, the state of Illinois, the University of Illinois, business and industry partners, and other federal agencies.</p>
        <p>NCSA provides leading-edge computing, data storage, and visualization resources.</p>
        <p>NCSA computational and data environment implements a multi-architecture hardware strategy, deploying both clusters and shared memory systems to support high-end users and communities on the architectures best-suited to their requirements.</p>
        <p>Nearly 1,360 scientists, engineers and students used the computing and data systems at NCSA to support research in more than 830 projects.</p>
