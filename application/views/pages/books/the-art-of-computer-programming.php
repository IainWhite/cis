        <p><strong>The Art of Computer Programming</strong> (sometimes known by its initials <strong>TAOCP</strong>) is a comprehensive monograph written by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Donald Knuth', 'P'); ?> that covers many kinds of programming algorithms and their analysis.</p>
        <p>Knuth began the project, originally conceived as a single book with twelve chapters, in 1962. The first three of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. The first installment of Volume 4 (a paperback fascicle) was published in 2005. The hardback volume 4A was published in 2011. Additional fascicle installments are planned for release approximately biannually.</p>
