        <p><strong>Konrad Zuse</strong> (22 June 1910 - 18 December 1995) was a German inventor and computer pioneer.</p>
        <p>His greatest achievement was the world's first programmable computer; the functional program controlled Turing complete <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Zuse Z3', 'ITH'); ?> became operational in May 1941.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer.</p>
        <p>Zuse was also noted for the <strong>S2</strong> computing machine, considered the first process controlled computer.</p>
        <p>He founded one of the earliest computer businesses in 1941, producing the Z4, which became the world's first commercial computer.</p>
        <p>In 1969, Zuse suggested the concept of a computation based universe in his book <em>Rechnender Raum</em> (<em>Calculating Space</em>).</p>
        <p>Due to World War II, Zuse's work went largely unnoticed in the United Kingdom and the United States. Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>'s option on his patents in 1946.</p>
