        <p><strong>Stephen Gary "Steve" Wozniak</strong> (born 11 August 1950), known as "<strong>Woz</strong>", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, and computer programmer who co-founded <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Computer', 'C'); ?> (now Apple Inc) with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Jobs', 'P'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ronald Wayne', 'P'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Wozniak single handedly designed both the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple I', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple II', 'ITH'); ?> computers in the late 1970s.</p>
        <p>These computers contributed significantly to the microcomputer revolution.</p>
        <p>The name on Wozniak's birth certificate is "Stephen Gary Wozniak", but Steve's mother said that she intended it to be spelled "Stephen", and "Steve" is what he uses.</p>
        <p>Wozniak has been referred to frequently by the nickname "<em>Woz</em>", "<em>The Wonderful Wizard of Woz</em>", or "<em>The Woz</em>".</p>
        <p>"WoZ" (short for "Wheels of Zeus") is also the name of a company Wozniak founded.</p>
