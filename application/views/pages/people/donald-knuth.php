        <p><strong>Donald Ervin Knuth</strong> (born 10 January 1938) is an American computer scientist, mathematician, and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University.</p>
        <p>He is the author of the multi-volume work <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('The Art of Computer Programming', 'B'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Knuth has been called the "<em>father</em>" of the analysis of algorithms.</p>
        <p>He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematised formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularised the asymptotic notation.</p>
        <p>In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TeX', 'ITS'); ?> computer typesetting system, the related <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('METAFONT', 'IT'); ?> font definition language and rendering system, and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Computer Modern', 'IT'); ?> family of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('typefaces', 'IT'); ?>.</p>
