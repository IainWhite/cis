        <p><strong>John Warner Backus</strong> (3 December 1924 - 17 March 2007) was an American computer scientist.</p>
        <p>He directed the team that invented the first widely used high-level programming language (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FORTRAN', 'L'); ?>) and was the inventor of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Backus-Naur Form', 'SD'); ?> (BNF), a widely used notation to define formal language syntax.</p>
        <p>He also did research in function level programming and helped to popularise it.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IEEE', 'C'); ?> awarded Backus the W.W. McDowell Award in 1967 for the development of FORTRAN.</p>
        <p>He received the National Medal of Science in 1975, and the 1977 <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Turing Award', 'IT'); ?> "<em>for profound, influential, and lasting contributions to the design of practical high-level programming systems, notably through his work on FORTRAN, and for publication of formal procedures for the specification of programming languages.</em>"</p>
