        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Nicola Pellow'); ?>
        <p><strong>Nicola Pellow</strong> was a member of the <strong>World Wide Web Project</strong> at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CERN', 'C'); ?>, working with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Tim Berners-Lee', 'P'); ?>.</p>
        <p>She joined the project in November 1990, while an undergraduate math student at Leicester Polytechnic.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately after Berners-Lee completed the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WorldWideWeb', 'WB'); ?> web browser for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NeXT', 'ITH'); ?> platform, Pellow wrote a generic Line Mode Browser called <strong>WWW</strong> that could run on non-NeXT systems.</p>
        <p>The WWW team ported the browser to a range of computers, from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>, so that anyone could access the web, which at that point consisted primarily of the CERN phone book.</p>
        <p>She left CERN at the end of August 1991, but returned after graduating in 1992, and worked with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Robert Cailliau', 'P'); ?> on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MacWWW', 'WB'); ?>, the first web browser for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
