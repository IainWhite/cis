        <p><strong>Grace Murray Hopper</strong> (9 December 1906 - 1 January 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.</p>
        <p>A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers of the <strong>Harvard Mark I</strong> computer, and developed the first compiler for a computer programming language.</p>
        <p>She popularised the idea of machine independent programming languages, which led to the development of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('COBOL', 'L'); ?>, one of the first modern programming languages.</p>
        <p>She is credited with popularising the term "<strong><em>debugging</em></strong>" for fixing computer glitches (inspired by an actual moth removed from the computer).</p>
        <p>Owing to the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "<em>Amazing Grace</em>".</p>
        <p>The U.S. Navy destroyer <strong>USS Hopper</strong> (DDG-70) is named for her, as was the <strong>Cray XE6 "Hopper"</strong> supercomputer at NERSC.</p>
