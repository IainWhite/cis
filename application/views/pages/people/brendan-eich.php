        <p><strong>Brendan Eich</strong> (born 1961) is a computer programmer and creator of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> programming language. He is the Chief Technology Officer at the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Corporation', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>In early 1995 <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Netscape', 'C'); ?> hired Brendan Eich away from MicroUnity Systems Engineering, to take charge of the design and implementation of a new language.</p>
        <p>Tasked with making Navigator's newly added <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> support more accessible to non Java programmers, Eich eventually decided that a loosely typed scripting language suited the environment and audience without a bytecode compiler or knowledge of object-oriented software design.</p>
        <p>The language he created was christened "<strong>LiveScript</strong>" to reflect its dynamic nature, but was soon renamed "<strong>JavaScript</strong>".</p>
        <p>On 4 December, 1995 Netscape and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sun', 'C'); ?> jointly announced the new language, calling it a '<em>complement</em>' to both <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?></strong> and <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?></strong>.</p>
