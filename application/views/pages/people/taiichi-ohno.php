        <p><strong>Taiichi Ohno</strong> (29 February 1912 - 28 May 1990) was a Japanese businessman.</p>
        <p>He is considered to be the father of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Toyota Production System', 'PM'); ?>, which became <strong>Lean Manufacturing</strong>.</p>
        <p>He devised the seven wastes (or <em>muda</em> in Japanese) as part of this system.</p>
        <p>He wrote several books about the system, including <em>Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production</em>.</p>
        <p>Born in 1912 in Dalian, China, and a graduate of the Nagoya Technical High School (Japan), he joined the Toyoda family's Toyoda Spinning upon graduation in 1932 during the Great Depression thanks to the relations of his father to Kiichiro Toyoda, the son of Toyota's founding father Sakichi Toyoda.</p>
        <p>He moved to the Toyota motor company in 1943, and gradually rose through the ranks to become an executive.</p>
        <p>In what is considered to be a slight, possibly because he spoke publicly about the production system, he was denied the normal executive track and was sent instead to consult with suppliers in his later career.</p>
        <p>Ohno's principles influenced areas outside of manufacturing, and have been extended into the service arena.</p>
