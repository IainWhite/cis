        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Melvin Conway'); ?>
        <p><strong>Melvin Edward Conway</strong> was an early computer scientist / computer programmer who coined what's now known as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink("Conway's Law", 'W'); ?>: "<em>Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.</em>"</p>
        <p>Apart from the above, Conway is perhaps most famous for his seminal paper on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('coroutines', 'SD'); ?>. In this paper he proposed to organize compiler as a set of coroutines, which gives possibility of using separate passes in debugging and then running a single pass compiler in production.</p>
        <p>Another famous paper is his exposition of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UNCOL', 'SD'); ?> in 1958.</p>
        <p>Conway wrote an assembler for the Burroughs model 220 computer called <strong>SAVE</strong>. The name SAVE was not an acronym, but a feature: programmers lost fewer punched card decks because they all had "SAVE" written on them.</p>
        <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, he was involved with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MUMPS', 'L'); ?> medical computer language and system language standard specification for the National Bureau of Standards. He also wrote a reference book on MUMPS.</p>
