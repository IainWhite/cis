        <p><strong>William Henry "Bill" Gates III</strong> (born 28 October 1955) is an American business magnate, philanthropist, investor, computer programmer, and inventor.</p>

        <p>During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of CEO and chief software architect, and remains the largest individual shareholder, with 6.4 percent of the common stock.</p>

        <p>Gates has been criticised for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by judicial courts.</p>
        <p>In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organisations and scientific research programs through the <strong>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</strong>, established in 2000.</p>
        <p>Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie, chief software architect, and Craig Mundie, chief research and strategy officer.</p>
        <p>Gates's last full-time day at Microsoft was 27 June 2008.</p>
        <p>He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014, taking on a new post as technology advisor to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.</p>
