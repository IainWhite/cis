        <p><strong>Sir Clive Marles Sinclair</strong> (born 30 July 1940) is an English entrepreneur and inventor, most commonly known for his work in consumer electronics in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
        <p>After spending several years as assistant editor of Practical Wireless and Instrument Practice, Sinclair founded <strong>Sinclair Radionics</strong> in 1961, where he produced the first slim-line electronic pocket calculator in 1972 (the Sinclair Executive). Sinclair later moved into the production of home computers and produced the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sinclair ZX80', 'ITH'); ?>, the UK's first mass-market home computer for less than 100GBP, and later, with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sinclair Research', 'C'); ?>, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ZX81', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ZX Spectrum', 'ITH'); ?>; the latter is widely recognised for its importance in the early days of the British home computer industry.</p>
        <p>Knighted in 1983, Sinclair formed <strong>Sinclair Vehicles</strong> and released the <strong>Sinclair C5</strong>, a battery electric vehicle that was a commercial failure. Since then Sinclair has concentrated on personal transport, including the <strong>A-bike</strong>, a folding bicycle for commuters that weighs 5.5 kilograms (12lb) and folds down small enough to be carried on public transport.</p>
