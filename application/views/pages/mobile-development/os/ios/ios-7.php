        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> announced <strong>iOS 7</strong> on 10 June 2013 at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WWDC', 'IT'); ?>) event, with release announced for sometime in Fall (Northern Hemisphere) or Spring (Southern Hemisphere) 2013. At their <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?> event on 10 September 2013, Apple announced the full release of iOS 7 for 18 September 2013, while also unveiling two new iPhone models: the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5C', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5S', 'ITH'); ?>. With this release, support was once again dropped for older devices, specifically the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 3GS', 'ITH'); ?> (due to hardware limitations) and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPod Touch', 'ITH'); ?> (4th generation) (due to performance issues). Supported devices on this release include the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 4', 'ITH'); ?> onwards, iPod Touch (5th generation), the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad 2', 'ITH'); ?> onwards, and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad Mini', 'ITH'); ?> (1st generation) onwards. iOS 7.1.2 is the final release on the iPhone 4. But, Apple can detect an unauthorised install and deactivate the device.</p>
