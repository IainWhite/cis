        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('iPhone OS 1.x'); ?>
        <p>First iteration of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>'s touch-centric mobile operating system. No official name given on its initial release; Apple marketing literature simply stating the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?> runs a version of Apple's desktop operating system, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>. On 6 March 2008, with the release of the iPhone software development kit (iPhone SDK), Apple named it iPhone OS (they went on to rename it "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?>" on 7 June 2010).</p>
