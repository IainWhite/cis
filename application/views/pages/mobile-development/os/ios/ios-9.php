        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> announced <strong>iOS 9</strong> on 8 June 2015 at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WWDC', 'IT'); ?>) event, with release announced for sometime in Fall (Northern Hemisphere) or Spring (Southern Hemisphere) 2015. With this release, Apple did not drop support for any iOS devices, with all devices supporting iOS 8 being eligible for an upgrade. Supported devices on this release include the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 4S', 'ITH'); ?> onwards, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPod Touch', 'ITH'); ?> (5th generation) onwards, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad 2', 'ITH'); ?> onwards, and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad Mini', 'ITH'); ?> (1st generation) onwards. The iPad 2 is also the first iOS device to support 6 major releases of iOS, supporting iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This is the greatest amount of major iOS releases a single iOS device has supported, surpassing the iPhone 4S which supports 5 major releases (iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) and iPod Touch 5th Generation supports 4 major releases (iOS 6, 7, 8, and 9). However, iOS 9 has limited support for the iPad 2, iPhone 4S, the iPad Mini (1st Generation), and the iPod touch 5th Generation. iOS 9 is currently in the beta stage with the latest beta being iOS 9.0 beta 3. Apple released a public beta similar to <strong>OS X El Capitan</strong> to users willing to test the beta on 8 July 2015.</p>
