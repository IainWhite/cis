        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> announced <strong>Android 4.4 KitKat</strong> on 3 September 2013. Although initially under the "<strong>Key Lime Pie</strong>" ("KLP") codename, the name was changed because "very few people actually know the taste of a key lime pie". Some technology bloggers also expected the "Key Lime Pie" release to be Android 5. KitKat debuted on Google's Nexus 5 on 31 October 2013, and was optimised to run on a greater range of devices than earlier Android versions, having 512MB of RAM as a recommended minimum; those improvements were known as "Project Svelte" internally at Google. The required minimum amount of RAM available to Android is 340MB, and all devices with less than 512MB of RAM must report themselves as "low RAM" devices.</p>
