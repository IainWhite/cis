        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> announced <strong>Android 4.1</strong> (<strong>Jelly Bean</strong>) at the Google I/O conference on 27 June 2012. Based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux kernel', 'OS'); ?> 3.0.31, Jelly Bean was an incremental update with the primary aim of improving the functionality and performance of the user interface. The performance improvement involved "Project Butter", which uses touch anticipation, triple buffering, extended vsync timing and a fixed frame rate of 60fps to create a fluid and "buttery-smooth" UI. Android 4.1 Jelly Bean was released to the Android Open Source Project on 9 July 2012, and the <strong>Nexus 7</strong> tablet, the first device to run Jelly Bean, was released on 13 July 2012.</p>
        <p>Google was expected to announce Jelly Bean 4.2 at an event in New York City on 29 October 2012, but the event was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy. Instead of rescheduling the live event, Google announced the new version with a press release, under the slogan "A new flavour of Jelly Bean". Jelly Bean 4.2 was based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux kernel', 'OS'); ?> 3.4.0, and debuted on Google's Nexus 4 and Nexus 10, which were released on 13 November 2012.</p>
        <p>Google released Jelly Bean 4.3 under the slogan "An even sweeter Jelly Bean" on July 24, 2013, during an event in San Francisco called "Breakfast with Sundar Pichai". Most Nexus devices received the update within a week, although the second generation Nexus 7 tablet was the first device to officially ship with it. A minor bugfix update was released on 22 August 2013.</p>
