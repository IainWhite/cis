        <p><strong>Android 5.0 "Lollipop"</strong> was unveiled under the codename "Android L" on 25 June 2014, during Google I/O. It became available as official over-the-air (OTA) updates on 12 November 2014, for select devices that run distributions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> serviced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>, including Nexus and Google Play edition devices. Its source code was made available on 3 November 2014.</p>
        <p>Lollipop features a redesigned user interface built around a responsive design language referred to as "material design". Other changes include improvements to the notifications, which can be accessed from the lockscreen and displayed within applications as top-of-the-screen banners. Furthermore, Google made internal changes to the platform, with the Android Runtime (ART) officially replacing Dalvik for improved application performance, and with changes intended to improve and optimize battery usage, known internally as Project Volta.</p>
