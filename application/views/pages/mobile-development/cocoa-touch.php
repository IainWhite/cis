        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Cocoa Touch'); ?>
        <p><strong>Cocoa Touch</strong> is a UI framework for building software programs to run on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> operating system (for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPod Touch', 'ITH'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad', 'ITH'); ?>) from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Cocoa Touch provides an abstraction layer of iOS, the operating system for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.</p>
        <p>Cocoa Touch is based on the Mac OS X Cocoa API toolset and, like it, is primarily written in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Objective-C', 'L'); ?> language.</p>
        <p>Cocoa Touch allows the use of hardware and features that are not found in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?> computers and are thus unique to the iOS range of devices.</p>
        <p>Just like <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Cocoa', 'SD'); ?>, Cocoa Touch follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architecture.</p>
        <p>Tools for developing applications based on Cocoa Touch are included in the iOS SDK.</p>
