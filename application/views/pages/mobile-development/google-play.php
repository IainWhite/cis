        <p><strong>Google Play</strong>, originally the <strong>Android Market</strong>, is a digital distribution platform operated by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>,. It serves as the official <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('app store', 'MD'); ?>, for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>, operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the Android SDK and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a digital media store, offering music, magazines, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, Google Store, on 11 March 2015.</p>
        <p>Applications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly to an Android or Google TV device through the Play Store mobile app, or by deploying the application to a device from the Google Play website. Many applications can be targeted to specific users based on a particular hardware attribute of their device, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling).</p>
        <p>Google Play was launched on 6 March 2012, with the merger of Android Market, Google Music, and Google eBookstore, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services operating under the Google Play banner are: Google Play Music, Google Play Books, Google Play Newsstand, Google Play Movies & TV, and Google Play Games. The Google Play store has reached over 1.43 million apps published and over 50 billion downloads.</p>
