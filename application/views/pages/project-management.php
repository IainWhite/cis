        <p><strong>Project Management</strong> is the process and activity of planning, organising, motivating, and controlling resources, procedures and protocols to achieve specific goals in scientific or daily problems.</p>
        <p>A <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Project', 'PM'); ?> is a temporary endeavour designed to produce a unique product, service or result with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.</p>
        <p>The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with business as usual (or operations), which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to produce products or services.</p>
        <p>In practice, the management of these two systems is often quite different, and as such requires the development of distinct technical skills and management strategies.</p>
        <p>The primary challenge of Project Management is to achieve all of the project goals and objectives while honouring the preconceived constraints. The primary constraints are <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('scope', 'PM'); ?>, time, quality and budget. The secondary — and more ambitious — challenge is to optimize the allocation of necessary inputs and integrate them to meet pre-defined objectives.</p>
