        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics'); ?>
        <p><strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> (<strong>SVG</strong>) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.</p>
        <p>The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3C', 'C'); ?>) since 1999.</p>
        <p>SVG images and their behaviours are defined in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> text files. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.</p>
        <p>As XML files, SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, but are more often created with drawing software.</p>
        <p>All major modern web browsers including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Firefox', 'WB'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google Chrome', 'WB'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Opera', 'WB'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari', 'WB'); ?> have at least some degree of SVG support and can render the mark-up directly.</p>
