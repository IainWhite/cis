        <p><strong>Adobe Flash</strong> (formerly called <strong>Macromedia Flash</strong>) is a multimedia and software platform used for creating vector graphics, animation, games and rich Internet applications (RIAs) that can be viewed, played and executed in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Flash Player', 'ITS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Flash is frequently used to add streamed video or audio players, advertisement and interactive multimedia content to web pages, although usage of Flash on websites is declining.</p>
        <p>Flash manipulates vector and raster graphics to provide animation of text, drawings, and still images. It allows bidirectional streaming of audio and video, and it can capture user input via mouse, keyboard, microphone and camera.</p>
        <p>Flash applications and animations can be programmed using the object-oriented language called <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ActionScript', 'L'); ?>.</p>
