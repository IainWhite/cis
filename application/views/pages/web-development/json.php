        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)'); ?>
        <p><strong>JSON</strong> or <strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong>, is a text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange. Derived from the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> scripting language, JSON is a language for representing simple data structures and associative arrays, called objects. Despite its relationship to JavaScript, JSON is language-independent, with parsers available for many languages.</p>
        <p>The JSON format was originally specified by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Douglas Crockford', 'P'); ?>. The official Internet media type for JSON is <code>application/json</code>. The JSON filename extension is <code>.json</code>.</p>
        <p>The JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
