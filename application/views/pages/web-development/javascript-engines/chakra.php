        <p><strong>Chakra</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> for its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 9', 'IE'); ?> (IE9) web browser.</p>
        <p>A distinctive feature of the engine is that it JIT compiles scripts on a separate CPU core, parallel to the web browser.</p>
        <p>The engine is also able to access the computer's graphics processing unit (GPU), in particular for 3D graphics and video.</p>
        <p>Though Microsoft has in the past pointed out that other elements, such as rendering and marshalling, are just as important for a browser's overall performance, their improvements to the engine were in response to evolving competing browsers, compared to which IE8 was lagging behind in terms of {<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> processing speed.</p>
