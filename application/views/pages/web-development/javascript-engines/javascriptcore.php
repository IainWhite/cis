        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('JavaScriptCore JavaScript Engine'); ?>
        <p><strong>JavaScriptCore</strong> is a framework that provides a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> implementations, and provides this type of scripting in other contexts within <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>JavaScriptCore is originally derived from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KDE', 'C'); ?>'s JavaScript engine (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KJS', 'web-development/javascript-engines'); ?>) library (which is part of the KDE project) and the <strong>PCRE</strong> regular expression library.</p>
        <p>Since forking from KJS and PCRE, JavaScriptCore has been improved with many new features and greatly improved performance.</p>
        <p>On 2 June 2008, the WebKit project announced they rewrote JavaScriptCore as "<strong>SquirrelFish</strong>", a bytecode interpreter.</p>
        <p>The project evolved into <strong>SquirrelFish Extreme</strong> (abbreviated <strong>SFX</strong>, marketed as <strong>Nitro</strong>), announced on 18 September 2008, which compiles JavaScript into native machine code, eliminating the need for a bytecode interpreter and thus speeding up JavaScript execution.</p>
