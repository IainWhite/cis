        <p>The <strong>V8 JavaScript Engine</strong> is an open source <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google Chrome', 'WB'); ?> web browser.</p>
        <p>It has since seen use in many other projects.</p>
        <p>The first version of the V8 engine was released at the same time as the first version of Chrome, 2 September 2008.</p>
        <p>V8 compiles JavaScript to native machine code before executing it, instead of more traditional techniques such as interpreting bytecode or compiling whole program to machine code and executing it from a filesystem.</p>
        <p>The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime, based on heuristics of the code's execution profile.</p>
        <p>Optimization techniques used include in-lining, elision of expensive runtime properties, and in-line caching, among many others.</p>
