        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('KJS JavaScript Engine'); ?>
        <p><strong>KJS</strong> is <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KDE', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> that was originally developed for the KDE project's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Konqueror', 'WB'); ?> web browser by <strong>Harri Porten</strong> in 2000.</p>
        <p>On 13 June 2002, <strong>Maciej Stachowiak</strong> announced on a mailing list that <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> was releasing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScriptCore', 'web-development/javascript-engines'); ?>, a framework for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?> that was based on KJS.</p>
        <p>Through the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> project, JavaScriptCore has since evolved into <strong>SquirrelFish Extreme</strong>, a JavaScript engine that compiles <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> into native machine code.</p>
