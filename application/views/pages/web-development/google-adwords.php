        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Google AdWords'); ?>
        <p><strong>Google AdWords</strong> is an on-line advertising service that places advertising copy at the top or bottom of, or beside, the list of results <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> displays for a particular search query.</p>
        <p>The choice and placement of the ads is based in part on a proprietary determination of the relevance of the search query to the advertising copy.</p>
        <p>AdWords has evolved into Google's main source of revenue.</p>
        <p>AdWords offers pay-per-click, that is, cost-per-click (CPC) advertising, cost-per-thousand-impressions or cost-per-mille (CPM) advertising, and site-targeted advertising for text, banner, and rich-media ads.</p>
        <p>The AdWords program includes local, national, and international distribution.</p>
        <p>Google's text advertisements are short, consisting of one headline of 25 characters and two additional text lines of 35 characters each.</p>
        <p>Image ads can be one of several different <strong>Interactive Advertising Bureau (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IAB', 'C'); ?>)</strong> standard sizes.</p>
