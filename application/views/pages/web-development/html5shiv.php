        <p><strong>HTML5Shiv</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Javascript', 'L'); ?> workaround, created by <strong>Sjoerd Visscher</strong>, to enable styling of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML5', 'WD'); ?> elements in versions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?> prior to version 9, which do not allow unknown elements to be styled without <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Prior to version 9 of Internet Explorer there was little to no support for HTML5 elements and other HTML5 features.</p>
        <p>Internet Explorer commands a large percentage of the usage share of web browsers. Within the Internet Explorer percentage, most of its current usage as of February 2013 comes from version 9, with version 8 holding the second-highest and version 7 the third-highest value. With its high usage percentage, it is important to ensure that web pages function correctly in Internet Explorer. HTML5Shiv allows versions of Internet Explorer prior to version 9 to recognise the HTML5 tags and allows them to be styled using <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
