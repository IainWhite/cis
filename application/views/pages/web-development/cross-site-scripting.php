        <p><strong>Cross site scripting</strong> (<strong>XSS</strong>) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications.</p>
        <p>XSS enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users.</p>
        <p>A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('same origin policy', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007.</p>
        <p>Their effect may range from a petty nuisance to a significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.</p>
