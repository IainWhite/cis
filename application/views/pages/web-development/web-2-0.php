        <p><strong>Web 2.0</strong> describes <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wprld Wide Web', 'WD'); ?> sites that use technology beyond the static pages of earlier web sites.</p>
        <p>The term was coined in 1999 by <strong>Darcy DiNucci</strong> and was popularized by <strong>Tim O'Reilly</strong> at the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 conference in late 2004.</p>
        <p>Although Web 2.0 suggests a new version of the World Wide Web, it does not refer to an update to any technical specification, but rather to cumulative changes in the way web pages are made and used.</p>
        <p>A Web 2.0 site may allow users to interact and collaborate with each other in a social media dialogue as creators of user-generated content in a virtual community, in contrast to web sites where people are limited to the passive viewing of content.</p>
        <p>Whether Web 2.0 is substantively different from prior web technologies has been challenged by World Wide Web inventor Sir <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Tim Berners-Lee', 'P'); ?>, who describes the term as jargon.</p>
        <p>His original vision of the Web was "<em>a collaborative medium, a place where we [could] all meet and read and write</em>".</p>
