        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('LESS (Leaner CSS)'); ?>
        <p><strong>LESS</strong> (<strong>Leaner CSS</strong>) is a dynamic stylesheet language designed by Alexis Sellier. It is influenced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sass', 'CSS'); ?> and has influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass, which adapted its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?> like block formatting syntax.</p>
        <p>LESS is open-source. Its first version was written in Ruby, however in the later versions, use of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ruby', 'L'); ?> has been deprecated and replaced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?>. The indented syntax of LESS is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid LESS code with the same semantics. LESS provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, operators and functions; the main difference between LESS and other CSS precompilers being that LESS allows real-time compilation via <code>LESS.js</code> by the browser.</p>
        <p>LESS can run on the client-side and server-side or can be compiled into plain CSS.</p>
