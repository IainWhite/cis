        <p><strong>VRML</strong> (<strong>Virtual Reality Modeling Language</strong>, pronounced <em>vermal</em> or by its initials, originally (before 1995) known as the <strong>Virtual Reality Markup Language</strong>) is a standard file format for representing 3-dimensional (3D) interactive vector graphics, designed particularly with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?> in mind. It has been superseded by X3D.</p>
        <p>VRML is a text file format where, e.g., vertices and edges for a 3D polygon can be specified along with the surface colour, UV mapped textures, shininess, transparency, and so on.</p>
        <p>URLs can be associated with graphical components so that a web browser might fetch a webpage or a new VRML file from the Internet when the user clicks on the specific graphical component.</p>
        <p>Animations, sounds, lighting, and other aspects of the virtual world can interact with the user or may be triggered by external events such as timers.</p>
        <p>A special Script Node allows the addition of program code (e.g., written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ECMAScript', 'L'); ?>) to a VRML file.</p>
        <p>VRML files are commonly called "worlds" and have the <code>.wrl</code> extension.</p>
        <p>VRML files are in plain text and generally compresses well using gzip which is useful for transferring over the internet more quickly.</p>
        <p>Many 3D modelling programs can save objects and scenes in VRML format.</p>
