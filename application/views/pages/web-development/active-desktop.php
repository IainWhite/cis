        <p><strong>Active Desktop</strong> was a feature of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Internet Explorers 4', 'IE'); ?>'s optional Windows Desktop Update that allows the user to add <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> content to the desktop, along with some other features.</p>
        <p>This function was intended to be installed on the then current <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?> operating system.</p>
        <p>It was also included in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 98', 'WIN'); ?> and later Windows operating systems until <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Vista', 'WIN'); ?>, where the feature was discontinued. This corresponded to version Internet Explorer 4.0 to 6.x, but not <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 7', 'IE'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Users can add HTML both in place of the regular wallpaper and as independent re-sizable desktop items.</p>
        <p>Items available on-line can be regularly updated and synchronized so users can stay updated without visiting the website in their browser.</p>
        <p>Active Desktop works much like desktop widget technology in that it allows users to place customized information on their desktop.</p>
