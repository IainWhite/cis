        <p><strong>Social media</strong> is the interaction among people in which they create, share or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks.</p>
        <p>Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define social media as "<em>a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web 2.0', 'WD'); ?>, and that allow the creation and exchange of user generated content</em>".</p>
        <p>Furthermore, social media depend on mobile and web-based technologies to create highly interactive platforms through which individuals and communities share, co-create, discuss, and modify user generated content.</p>
        <p>They introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between organizations, communities, and individuals.</p>
        <p>Social media differ from traditional or industrial media in many ways, including quality, reach, frequency, usability, immediacy, and permanence.</p>
        <p>Social media technologies take on many different forms including magazines, Internet <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('forums', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('blogs', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('microblogging', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('wikis', 'WD'); ?>, social networks, podcasts, photographs or pictures, video, rating and social bookmarking.</p>
        <p>By applying a set of theories in the field of media research (social presence, media richness) and social processes (self-presentation, self-disclosure), Kaplan and Haenlein created a classification scheme in their Business Horizons (2010) article, with seven different types of social media:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Collaborative projects (for example, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wikipedia', 'URL'); ?>)</li>
            <li>Blogs and microblogs (for example, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Twitter', 'URL'); ?>)</li>
            <li>Social news networking sites (for example, Digg<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digg', 'URL'); ?>)</li>
            <li>Content communities (for example, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('YouTube', 'URL'); ?>)</li>
            <li>Social networking sites (for example, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Facebook', 'URL'); ?>)</li>
            <li>Virtual game worlds (for example,  <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>)</li>
            <li>Virtual social worlds (for example, <strong>Second Life</strong>)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>However, the boundaries between the different types have become increasingly blurred.</p>
