        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('DOM - Document Object Model'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Document Object Model</strong> (<strong>DOM</strong>) is a cross-platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XHTML', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> documents.</p>
        <p>Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects.</p>
        <p>The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('API', 'IT'); ?>).</p>
        <p>The history of the Document Object Model is intertwined with the history of the "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('browser wars', 'WD'); ?>" of the late 1990s between <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Netscape Navigator', 'WB'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?>, as well as with that of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JScript', 'JS'); ?>, the first scripting languages to be widely implemented in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engines', 'WD'); ?> of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browsers', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
