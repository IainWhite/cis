        <p><strong>SAX (Simple API for XML)</strong> is an event-driven online algorithm for parsing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> documents, with an API interface developed by the XML-DEV mailing list. SAX provides a mechanism for reading data from an XML document that is an alternative to that provided by the Document Object Model (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?>). Where the DOM operates on the document as a whole, SAX parsers operate on each piece of the XML document sequentially.</p>
