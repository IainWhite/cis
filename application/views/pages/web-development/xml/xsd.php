        <p><strong>XSD (XML Schema Definition)</strong>, a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3c', 'C'); ?>), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an <strong>Extensible Markup Language (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?>)</strong> document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in.</p>
        <p>Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered "valid" according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document's validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post validation infoset can be useful in the development of XML document processing software.</p>
