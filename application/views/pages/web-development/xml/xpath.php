        <p><strong>XPath</strong>, the XML Path Language, is a query language for selecting nodes from an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> document. In addition, XPath may be used to compute values (e.g., strings, numbers, or Boolean values) from the content of an XML document. XPath was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3C', 'C'); ?>).</p>
