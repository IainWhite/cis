        <p><strong>XSL Formatting Objects</strong>, or <strong>XSL-FO</strong>, is a markup language for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> document formatting which is most often used to generate PDFs. XSL-FO is part of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XSL', 'XML'); ?> (Extensible Stylesheet Language), a set of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3C', 'C'); ?> technologies designed for the transformation and formatting of XML data. The other parts of XSL are <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XSLT', 'XML'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XPath', 'XML'); ?>. Version 1.1 of XSL-FO was published in 2006.</p>
        <p>XSL-FO was discontinued: the last update for the Working Draft was in January 2012, and its Working Group closed in November 2013.</p>
