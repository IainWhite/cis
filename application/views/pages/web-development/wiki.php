        <p>A <strong>wiki</strong> is usually a web application which allows people to add, modify, or delete content in collaboration with others.</p>
        <p>Text is usually written using a simplified markup language or a rich-text editor.</p>
        <p>The word <em>Wiki</em> is a Hawaiian word meaning "<em>fast</em>" or "<em>quick</em>".</p>
        <p>While a wiki is a type of content management system, it differs from a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('blog', 'WD'); ?> or most other such systems in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.</p>
        <p>The encyclopedia project <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wikipedia', 'URL'); ?> is the most popular wiki on the public web in terms of page views, but there are many sites running many different kinds of wiki software.</p>
        <p>Wikis can serve many different purposes both public and private, including knowledge management, notetaking, community websites and intranets.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ward Cunningham', 'P'); ?>, the developer of the first wiki software, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WikiWikiWeb', 'URL'); ?>, originally described it as "<em>the simplest online database that could possibly work</em>".</p>
