        <p>A <strong>bulletin board system</strong>, or <strong>BBS</strong>, is a computer system running software that allows users to connect and log into the system using a terminal program.</p>
        <p>Once logged in, a user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users, either through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting.</p>
        <p>Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other.</p>
        <p>Originally BBSes were accessed only over a phone line using a modem, but by the early 1990s some BBSes allowed access via a Telnet, packet switched network, or packet radio connection.</p>
        <p><strong>Ward Christensen</strong> coined the term "<em>bulletin board system</em>" as a reference to the traditional cork-and-pin bulletin board often found in entrances of supermarkets, schools, libraries or other public areas where people can post messages, advertisements, or community news.</p>
        <p>By "computerizing" this method of communications, the name of the first BBS system was born: CBBS - Computerized Bulletin Board System.</p>
        <p>During their heyday from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, most BBSes were run as a hobby free of charge by the system operator (or "sysop"), while other BBSes charged their users a subscription fee for access, or were operated by a business as a means of supporting their customers.</p>
        <p>Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?>, social network services and other aspects of the Internet.</p>
        <p>As the use of the Internet became more widespread in the mid to late 1990s, traditional BBSes rapidly faded in popularity.</p>
        <p>Today, Internet forums occupy much of the same social and technological space as BBSes did.</p>
        <p>Early BBSes were often a local phenomenon (in countries with free local phone calls), as one had to dial into a BBS with a phone line and would have to pay additional long-distance calling charges for a BBS out of the local calling area.</p>
