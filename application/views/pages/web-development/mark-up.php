        <p>A (document) <strong>mark-up</strong> language is a modern system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.</p>
        <p>The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.</p>
        <p>In digital media this "blue pencil instruction text" was replaced by tags, that is, instructions are expressed directly by tags or "instruction text encapsulated by tags".</p>
        <p>Examples are typesetting instructions such as those found in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TeX', 'IT'); ?> or structural markers such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> tags.</p>
        <p>Mark-up instructs the software displaying the text to carry out appropriate actions, but is omitted from the version of the text that is displayed to users.</p>
        <p>Some mark-up languages, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?>, have pre-defined presentation semantics, meaning that their specification prescribes how the structured data are to be presented; others, such as XML, do not.</p>
        <p>A widely used mark-up language is the <strong>HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML)</strong>, one of the document formats of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>HTML, which is an instance of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SGML', 'WD'); ?> (though, strictly, it does not comply with all the rules of SGML), follows many of the mark-up conventions used in the publishing industry in the communication of printed work between authors, editors, and printers.</p>
