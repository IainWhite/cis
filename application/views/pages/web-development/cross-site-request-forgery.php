        <p><strong>Cross site request forgery</strong>, also known as a <strong>one-click attack</strong> or <strong>session riding</strong> and abbreviated as <strong>CSRF</strong> (sometimes pronounced <em>sea-surf</em>) or <strong>XSRF</strong>, is a type of malicious exploit of a website whereby unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.</p>
        <p>Unlike <strong>cross site scripting</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XSS', 'WD'); ?>), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.</p>
