        <p><strong>Facebook</strong> is an on-line <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('social networking', 'WD'); ?> service.</p>
        <p>Its name comes from a colloquialism for the directory given to students at some American universities.</p>
        <p>Facebook was founded on 4 February 2004 by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mark Zuckerberg', 'P'); ?> with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.</p>
        <p>The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University.</p>
        <p>It gradually added support for students at various other universities before it opened to high-school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over.</p>
        <p>Facebook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old to become a registered user of the website.</p>
        <p>Users must register before using the site, after which they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, exchange messages, and receive automatic notifications when they update their profile.</p>
        <p>Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organised by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorise their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends".</p>
        <p>In September 2012, Facebook had over one billion active users, of which approximately 9% were fake.</p>
