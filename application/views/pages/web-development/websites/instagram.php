        <p><strong>Instagram</strong> is an online photo-sharing, video-sharing and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('social networking', 'WD'); ?> service that enables its users to take pictures and videos, apply digital filters to them, and share them on a variety of social networking services, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Facebook', 'URL'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Twitter', 'URL'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Tumblr', 'URL'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Flickr', 'URL'); ?>.</p>
        <p>A distinctive feature is that it confines photos to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images, in contrast to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by mobile device cameras.</p>
        <p>Users are also able to record and share short videos lasting for up to 15 seconds.</p>
        <p>Instagram was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and launched in October 2010.</p>
        <p>The service rapidly gained popularity, with over 100 million active users as of April 2012.</p>
