        <p><strong>Google News</strong> is a free news aggregator provided and operated by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>, selecting up to date news from thousands of publications.</p>
        <p>A beta version was launched in September 2002, and released officially in January 2006.</p>
        <p>Google News watches more than 4500 news sources worldwide. Versions for more than 60 regions in 28 languages are available (as of 15 March 2012). As of January 2013, service in the following languages is offered: Arabic, Cantonese, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malayalam, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>The service covers news articles appearing within the past 30 days on various news websites. In total, Google News aggregates content from more than 25,000 publishers. For the English language, it covers about 4,500 sites; for other languages, fewer. Its front page provides roughly the first 200 characters of the article and a link to its larger content. Websites may or may not require a subscription; sites requiring subscription are noted in the article description.</p>
        <p>The layout of Google News underwent a major revision on 16 May 16, 2011.</p>
        <p></p>On 14 July 2011, Google introduced "Google News Badges," which it later retired in October 2012.</p>
        <p>Additionally in July 2011, the Sci/Tech section of the English Google News versions was split up into two sections: Science and Technology. It was announced that this section split would be performed on other language versions as well. As of early 2013, this split had not been applied to all language versions of Google News.</p>
