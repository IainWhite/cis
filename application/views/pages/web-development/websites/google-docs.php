        <p><strong>Google Docs, Sheets and Slides</strong> are a word processor, a spreadsheet and a presentation program respectively, all part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> within its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google Drive', 'URL'); ?> service. The suite allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating with other users in real-time.</p>
        <p>The three apps are available as web applications, as Chrome apps that work offline, and as mobile apps for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?>. The apps are compatible with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Office', 'ITS'); ?> file formats. The suite also consists of <strong>Google Forms</strong> (survey software), <strong>Google Drawings</strong> (diagramming software) and <strong>Google Fusion Tables</strong> (database manager). While Forms and Tables are only available as web applications, Drawings is also available as a Chrome app.</p>
        <p>The suite is tightly integrated with Google Drive. All files created with the apps are by default saved to Google Drive.</p>
