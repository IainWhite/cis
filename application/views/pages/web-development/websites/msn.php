        <p><strong>MSN</strong> (stylised as msn) is a web portal and related collection of Internet services and apps for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> and mobile devices, provided by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> and launched on 24 August 1995, the same release date as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Along with Windows 95's release, Microsoft debuted The Microsoft Network, a subscription-based dial-up online service that it later turned into an Internet service provider named MSN Dial-up. At the same time, the company launched a new web portal named Microsoft Internet Start and set it as the first default home page of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?>, its original web browser. In 1998, Microsoft renamed and moved this web portal to the domain name MSN.com, where it has remained since then.</p>
        <p>In addition to its original MSN Dial-up service, Microsoft has used the 'MSN' brand name for a wide variety of products and services over the years, notably <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Hotmail', 'URL'); ?> (which is now <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Outlook.com', 'URL'); ?>), Messenger (which was once synonymous with 'MSN' in Internet slang and has now been replaced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Skype', 'URL'); ?>), and its search engine (which is now <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bing', 'URL'); ?>), as well as several other rebranded and discontinued services.</p>
        <p>The current website and suite of apps offered by MSN was first introduced by Microsoft in 2014 as part of a complete redesign and relaunch. MSN is based in the United States and offers international versions of its portal for dozens of countries around the world.</p>
