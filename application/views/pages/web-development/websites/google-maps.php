        <p><strong>Google Maps</strong> is a desktop and mobile web mapping service application and technology provided by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>, offering satellite imagery, street maps, and Street View perspectives, as well as functions such as a route planner for travelling by foot, car, bicycle, or with public transportation.</p>
        <p>Also supported are maps embedded on third-party websites via the Google Maps API, and a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world.</p>
        <p>Google Maps satellite images are not updated in real time; however, Google adds data to their Primary Database on a regular basis, and most of the images are no more than 3 years old.</p>

        <h2>Google Maps API</h2>
        <p>After the success of reverse-engineered mash-ups such as <code>chicagocrime.org</code> and <code>housingmaps.com</code>, Google launched the Google Maps API in June 2005 to allow developers to integrate Google Maps into their websites.</p>
        <p>It is a free service, and currently does not contain ads, but Google states in their terms of use that they reserve the right to display ads in the future.</p>
        <p>By using the Google Maps API, it is possible to embed Google Maps site into an external website, on to which site specific data can be overlaid.</p>
        <p>Although initially only a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> API, the Maps API was expanded to include an API for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Flash', 'WD'); ?> applications (but this has been deprecated), a service for retrieving static map images, and web services for performing geocoding, generating driving directions, and obtaining elevation profiles.</p>
        <p>Over 1,000,000 web sites use the Google Maps API, making it the most heavily used web application development API.</p>
        <p>The Google Maps API is free for commercial use, provided that the site on which it is being used is publicly accessible and does not charge for access, and is not generating more than 25000 map accesses a day.</p>
        <p>Sites that do not meet these requirements can purchase the Google Maps API for Business.</p>
        <p>The success of the Google Maps API has spawned a number of competing alternatives, including the <strong>Yahoo! Maps API</strong>, <strong>Bing Maps Platform</strong>, <strong>MapQuest Development Platform</strong>, and <strong>OpenLayers</strong>.</p>
