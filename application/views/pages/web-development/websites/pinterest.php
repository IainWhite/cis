        <p><strong>Pinterest</strong> is a visual discovery tool that people use to collect ideas for their different projects and interests.</p>
        <p>People create and share collections (called "<em>boards</em>") of visual bookmarks (called "<em>Pins</em>") that they use to do things like plan trips and projects, organize events or save articles and recipes.</p>
        <p>The site was founded by Ben Silbermann, Paul Sciarra and Evan Sharp.</p>
        <p>Pinterest is written with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Django Framework', 'L'); ?>, a web application framework that uses the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Python', 'L'); ?> scripting language.</p>
        <p>Pinterest users can upload, save, sort and manage images, known as pins, and other media content (e.g. videos and gifs) through collections known as pinboards.</p>
        <p>Pinterest acts as a personalized media platform, whereby users' content and the content of others can be browsed on the main page.</p>
        <p>Users can then save individual pins to one of their own boards using the "Pin It" button, with Pinboards typically organized by a central topic or theme.</p>
        <p>Content can also be found outside of Pinterest and similarly uploaded to a board via the "Pin It" button which can be downloaded to the bookmark bar on a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?>, or be implemented by a webmaster directly on the website.</p>
        <p>They also have the option of sending a pin to other Pinterest users and / or email accounts through the "Send" button.</p>
