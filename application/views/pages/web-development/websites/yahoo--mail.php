        <p><strong>Yahoo! Mail</strong> is a free email service (except for Yahoo Mail Business Email Plans) offered by the American company <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Yahoo!', 'C'); ?>. It was launched in 1997, and, according to comScore, Yahoo Mail was the third largest web-based email service with 281 million users as of December 2011.</p>
        <p>As many as three web interfaces were available at any given date. The traditional "Yahoo Mail Classic" preserved the availability of their original 1997 interface until July 2013 in North America. A 2005 version included a new <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AJAX', 'WD'); ?> interface, drag-and-drop, improved search, keyboard shortcuts, address auto-completion and tabs. However other features were removed, such as column widths and one click delete-move-to-next. In October 2010, Yahoo released a beta version of Yahoo Mail that included improvements to performance, search and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Facebook', 'URL'); ?> integration. In May 2011 it became the default interface. Their current Webmail interface was introduced during 2012. Yahoo Mail had unlimited storage from 27 March 2007 until 8 October 2013. The new design introduced to users from October 2013 was met with heavy criticism of its layout and user ability. Yahoo Mail suffered a major outage where some users could not access their email messages beginning 10 December 2013 until 12 December 2013, when the outage was fully resolved.</p>
