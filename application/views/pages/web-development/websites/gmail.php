        <p><strong>Gmail</strong> is a free, advertising-supported <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('email', 'WD'); ?> service provided by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Users may access Gmail as secure webmail, as well as via <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('POP3', 'IPA'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IMAP4', 'IPA'); ?> protocols.</p>
        <p>Gmail initially started as an invitation-only beta release on 1 April 1, 2004 and it became available to the general public on 7 February 2007, though still in beta status at that time.</p>
        <p>The service was upgraded from beta status on 7 July 2009, along with the rest of the Google Apps suite.</p>
        <p>With an initial storage capacity offer of 1GB per user, Gmail significantly increased the webmail standard for free storage from the 2 to 4MB its competitors such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Hotmail', 'URL'); ?> offered at that time.</p>
        <p>Individual Gmail messages, including attachments, may be up to 25MB.</p>
        <p>Gmail has a search-oriented interface and a "conversation view" similar to an Internet forum.</p>
        <p>Gmail is noted by web developers for its pioneering use of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AJAX', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
