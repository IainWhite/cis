        <p><strong>Outlook.com</strong> is a free web-based email service run by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>;. One of the world's first webmail services, it was founded in 1996 as <strong>Hotmail</strong> (stylised as HoTMaiL) by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith in Mountain View, California, and headquartered in Sunnyvale. Hotmail was acquired by Microsoft in 1997 for an estimated $400 million and launched as MSN Hotmail, later rebranded to Windows Live Hotmail as part of the Windows Live suite of products. The last version of Hotmail was released in October 2011. As of mid-2011, Hotmail had 360 million users per month. It was available in 36 languages. In 2013, Hotmail was replaced with Outlook.com, which features Microsoft's Metro design language, and closely mimics the interface of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Outlook', 'ITS'); ?>. It also features unlimited storage, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AJAX', 'WD'); ?>, and integration with Calendar, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OneDrive', 'URL'); ?>, People and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Skype', 'URL'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Hotmail service was founded by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith, and was one of the first webmail services on the Internet along with Four11's <strong>RocketMail</strong> (later <strong>Yahoo! Mail</strong>). It was commercially launched on 4 July 1996, symbolising "freedom" from ISP-based email and the ability to access a user's inbox from anywhere in the world. The name "Hotmail" was chosen out of many possibilities ending in "-mail" as it included the letters HTML, the markup language used to create web pages (to emphasise this, the original type casing was "HoTMaiL"). The limit for free storage was 2M. Hotmail was initially backed by venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. By December 1997, it reported more than 8.5 million subscribers. Hotmail initially ran under <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Solaris', 'OS'); ?> for mail services and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apache', 'WS'); ?> on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FreeBSD', 'LIN'); ?> for web services, before being partly converted to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> products, using Windows Services for UNIX in the migration path.</p>
        <p>Hotmail was sold to Microsoft in December 1997 for a reported $400 million, and it joined the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MSN', 'URL'); ?> group of services. Hotmail quickly gained in popularity as it was localised for different markets around the globe, and became the world's largest webmail service with more than 30 million active members reported by February 1999. Hotmail originally ran on a mixture of FreeBSD and Solaris operating systems. A project was started to move Hotmail to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 2000', 'WIS'); ?>. In June 2001, Microsoft claimed this had been completed; a few days later they retracted and admitted that the DNS functions of the Hotmail system were still reliant on FreeBSD. In 2002 Hotmail still ran its infrastructure on [UNIX] servers, merely the front-end was converted to Windows 2000. Later development saw the service tied with Microsoft's web authentication scheme, Microsoft Passport (now Microsoft account), and integration with Microsoft's instant messaging and social networking programs, MSN Messenger and MSN Spaces (now Windows Live Messenger and Windows Live Spaces, respectively).</p>
