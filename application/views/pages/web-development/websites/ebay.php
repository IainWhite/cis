        <p>The company <strong>eBay Inc.</strong> is an American multinational Internet consumer-to-consumer corporation, head-quartered in San Jose, California.</p>
        <p>It was founded by <strong>Pierre Omidyar</strong> in 1995, and it became a notable success story of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('dot-com bubble', 'WD'); ?>; it is now a multi-billion dollar business with operations localized in over thirty countries.</p>
        <p>The company manages <?php echo $this->stencil->addExternalLink('eBay.com', 'http://eBay.com/'); ?>, an on-line auction and shopping website in which people and businesses buy and sell a broad variety of goods and services worldwide.</p>
        <p>In addition to its auction-style sellings, the website has since expanded to include "Buy It Now" standard shopping; shopping by UPC, ISBN, or other kind of SKU (via Half.com); on-line classified advertisements (via Kijiji or eBay Classifieds); on-line event ticket trading (via StubHub); on-line money transfers (via <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PayPal', 'URL'); ?>) and other services.</p>

        <h2>Early Years</h2>
        <p><strong>AuctionWeb</strong> was founded in San Jose, California, on 3 September 1995, by French-born Iranian-American computer programmer Pierre Omidyar (born 21 June 1967) as part of a larger personal site that included, among other things, Omidyar's own tongue-in-cheek tribute to the Ebola virus.</p>
        <p>One of the first items sold on AuctionWeb was a broken laser pointer for $14.83. Astonished, Omidyar contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the laser pointer was broken. In his responding email, the buyer explained: "I'm a collector of broken laser pointers".</p>
        <p>Reportedly, eBay was simply a side hobby for Omidyar until his Internet service provider informed him he would need to upgrade to a business account due to the high volume of traffic to his website.</p>
        <p>The resulting price increase (from $30/month to $250) forced him to start charging those who used eBay, and was not met with any animosity.</p>
        <p>In fact it resulted in the hiring of <strong>Chris Agarpao</strong> as eBay's first employee to handle the number of cheques coming in for fees.</p>
        <p><strong>Jeffrey Skoll</strong> was hired as the first president of the company in early 1996.</p>
        <p>In November 1996, eBay entered into its first third-party licensing deal, with a company called <strong>Electronic Travel Auction</strong> to use <strong>SmartMarket Technology</strong> to sell plane tickets and other travel products.</p>
        <p>Growth was phenomenal; in January 1997 the site hosted 2,000,000 auctions, compared with 250,000 during the whole of 1996.</p>
        <p>The company officially changed the name of its service from AuctionWeb to eBay in September 1997.</p>
        <p>Originally, the site belonged to <strong>Echo Bay Technology Group</strong>, Omidyar's consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Omidyar had tried to register the domain name <code>echobay.com</code>, but found it already taken by the <strong>Echo Bay Mines</strong>, a gold mining company, so he shortened it to his second choice, <code>eBay.com</code>.</p>
