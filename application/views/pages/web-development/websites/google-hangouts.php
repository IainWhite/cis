        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Google Hangouts'); ?>
        <p><strong>Google Hangouts</strong> is a communication platform developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> which includes <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('instant messaging', 'IT'); ?>, video chat, SMS and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VoIP', 'IT'); ?> features. It replaces three messaging products that Google had implemented concurrently within its services, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google talk', 'IM'); ?>, <strong>Google+ Messenger</strong> (formerly: <strong>Huddle</strong>), and Hangouts, a video chat system present within Google+. Google has also stated that Hangouts is designed to be "the future" of its telephony product, Google Voice, and integrated some of the capabilities of Google Voice into Hangouts. In current versions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>, Hangouts is the default application for text messaging.</p>
        <p>Prior to the launch of Hangouts, Google had maintained several similar, but technologically separate messaging services and platforms across its suite of products. These have included the enterprise oriented Google Talk (based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XMPP', 'IM'); ?>), Google+ Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which allows for group videoconferencing with up to 10 users at once. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Facebook Messenger', 'IM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iMessage', 'IM'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WhatsApp', 'IM'); ?>. A decision was made to scrap the existing Google Talk system and code a new messaging product through a collaboration with multiple development teams.</p>
        <p>Following reports that the new service would be known as "<em>Babel</em>", the service officially launched as Hangouts during the Google I/O conference on 15 May 2013.</p>
