        <p><strong>iCloud</strong> is a cloud storage and cloud computing service from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?> launched on 12 October 2011. As of July 2013, the service had 320 million users.</p>
        <p>The service provides its users with means to store data such as documents, photos, and music on remote servers for download to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> devices, to share and send data to other users, and to manage their Apple devices if lost or stolen.</p>
        <p>The service also provides the means to wirelessly back up iOS devices directly to iCloud, instead of being reliant on manual backups to a host Mac or Windows computer using <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iTunes', 'IT'); ?>. Service users are also able to share photos, music, and games instantly by linking accounts via <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AirDrop', 'IT'); ?> wireless.</p>
        <p>It replaced Apple's <strong>MobileMe</strong> service, acting as a data syncing center for email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, notes, reminders (to-do lists), iWork documents, photos and other data.</p>
