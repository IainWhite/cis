        <p><strong>Wikipedia</strong> is a collaboratively edited, multilingual, free <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'IT'); ?> encyclopedia that is supported by the non-profit <strong>Wikimedia Foundation</strong>.</p>
        <p>Volunteers worldwide collaboratively write Wikipedia's 30 million articles in 287 languages, including over 4.5 million in the English Wikipedia.</p>
        <p>Anyone who can access the site can edit almost any of its articles, which on the Internet comprise the largest and most popular general reference work.</p>
        <p>Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia on 15 January 2001, the latter creating its name, a portmanteau of <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('wiki', 'WD'); ?></strong> (the name of a type of collaborative website) and encyclo<strong>pedia</strong>.</p>
