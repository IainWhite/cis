        <p>Electronic spamming is the use of electronic messaging systems to send unsolicited messages (<strong>spam</strong>), especially advertising, as well as sending messages repeatedly on the same site. While the most widely recognised form of spam is [email] spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('instant messaging', 'ITS'); ?> spam, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Usenet', 'ITN'); ?> newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('blogs', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('wiki', 'WD'); ?> spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam, junk fax transmissions, social spam, television advertising and file sharing spam. It is named after Spam, a luncheon meat, by way of a Monty Python sketch in which Spam is included in every dish. The food is stereotypically disliked / unwanted, so the word came to be transferred by analogy.</p>
        <p>Spamming remains economically viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond the management of their mailing lists, and it is difficult to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. Because the barrier to entry is so low, spammers are numerous, and the volume of unsolicited mail has become very high. In the year 2011, the estimated figure for spam messages is around seven trillion. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have been forced to add extra capacity to cope with the deluge. Spamming has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>A person who creates electronic spam is called a spammer.</p>
