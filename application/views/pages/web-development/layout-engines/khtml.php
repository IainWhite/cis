        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('KHTML Layout Engine'); ?>
        <p><strong>KHTML</strong> is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engine', 'WD'); ?> developed by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KDE', 'C'); ?> project.</p>
        <p>It is the engine used by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Konqueror', 'WB'); ?> web browser.</p>
        <p>A forked version of KHTML called <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> is used by several web browsers, among them <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, KHTML is free software.</p>
        <p>Built on the <strong>KPart</strong> framework and written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++', 'languages/c'); ?>, KHTML has relatively good support for Web standards.</p>
        <p>To render as many pages as possible, some extra abilities and quirks from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?> are also supported, even though those are non-standard.</p>
        <p>KHTML was preceded by an earlier engine called <strong>khtmlw</strong> or the <strong>KDE HTML Widget</strong>, developed by <strong>Torben Weis</strong> and <strong>Martin Jones</strong>, which implemented support for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> 3.2, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTTP', 'WD'); ?> 1.0, and HTML frames, but not the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3C', 'C'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?>, or scripting.</p>
        <p>KHTML came into existence on 4 November 1998, as a copy of the khtmlw library, with some slight refactoring and the addition of Unicode support and changes to support the move to Qt 2.</p>
