        <p><strong>Tasman</strong> was a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engine', 'WD'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> for inclusion in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> version of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 5', 'IE'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Tasman was an attempt to improve support for web standards, as defined by the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3C', 'C'); ?>).</p>
        <p>At the time of its release, Tasman was seen as the layout engine with the best support for web standards such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer for Mac', 'IE'); ?> is no longer supported, but newer versions of Tasman are incorporated in some other Microsoft products.</p>
