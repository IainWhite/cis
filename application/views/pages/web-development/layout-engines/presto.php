        <p><strong>Presto</strong> was the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engine', 'WD'); ?> of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Opera', 'WB'); ?> web browser for a decade.</p>
        <p>It was released on 28 January 2003 in Opera 7, for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>, after several public betas and technical previews.</p>
        <p>In Opera 15, the browser's developer Opera Software ASA began using the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Blink', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> layout engine and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('V8', 'web-development/javascript-engine'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> combined with a modified <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chromium', 'WB'); ?> browser.</p>
        <p>Presto is a dynamic engine. Webpages could be re-rendered completely or partially in response to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?> events.</p>
        <p>Its releases saw a number of bug fixes and optimizations to improve the speed of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ECMAScript', 'JS'); ?> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?>) engine.</p>
        <p>It is proprietary software only available as a part of the Opera browsers.</p>
