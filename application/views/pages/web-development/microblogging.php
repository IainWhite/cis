        <p><strong>Microblogging</strong> is a broadcast medium that exists in the form of blogging.</p>
        <p>A microblog differs from a traditional <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('blog', 'WD'); ?> in that its content is typically smaller in both actual and aggregated file size.</p>
        <p>Microblogs "allow users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links". These small messages are sometimes called <em>microposts</em>.</p>
        <p>As with traditional blogging, microbloggers post about topics ranging from the simple, such as "<em>what I'm doing right now</em>" to the thematic, such as "<em>Internet Development</em>".</p>
