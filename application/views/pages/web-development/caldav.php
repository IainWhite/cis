        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('CalDAV - Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV'); ?>
        <p><strong>Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV</strong>, or <strong>CalDAV</strong>, is an Internet standard allowing a client to access scheduling information on a remote server. It extends <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebDAV', 'WD'); ?> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTTP', 'IPA'); ?> based protocol for data manipulation) specification and uses <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iCalendar', 'WD'); ?> format for the data. The access protocol is defined by <?php echo $this->stencil->addRFCLink('4791'); ?>. It allows multiple client access to the same information thus allowing cooperative planning and information sharing. Many server and client applications support the protocol. Extensions to CalDAV for automated scheduling are also standardised, as <?php echo $this->stencil->addRFCLink('6638'); ?>.</p>
