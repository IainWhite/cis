        <p><strong>C-HTML</strong> (short for <strong>Compact HyperText Markup Language</strong>), also called <strong>i-mode-HTML</strong>, is a subset of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> for small information devices, such as first generation smartphones and PDAs, such as DoCoMo's i-mode mobile phones used in Japan. C-HTML adds several features not found in standard HTML, notably accesskeys, phone number shortcuts for links, and emoji pictorial characters as locally extended Shift JIS, all concepts borrowed from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HDML', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WML', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Because small devices such as cellular phones have hardware restrictions such as lower memory, low-power CPUs with limited or no storage capabilities, small monochrome display screens, single-character fonts and restricted input methods (the absence of a keyboard or a mouse), there is a need for a simpler form of HTML.</p>
        <p>C-HTML does not support tables, image maps, multiple fonts and styling of fonts, background colours and images, frames, or style sheets, and is limited to a monochromatic display.</p>
        <p>The language is defined so that all the basic interactive operations can be done by a combination of four buttons and not by two-dimensional cursor movement: cursor forward, cursor backward, select, and back/stop. Functionality requiring two-dimensional cursor pointing, like image maps, is excluded from C-HTML.</p>
