        <p>From 1992 through 1996, <strong>Gopher</strong> was an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?> application in which hierarchically organized text files could be brought from servers all over the world to a viewer on your computer.</p>
        <p>Especially in universities, Gopher was a step toward the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?>'s Hypertext Transfer Protocol (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTTP', 'IPA'); ?>), which effectively replaced it within a short time.</p>
        <p>With hypertext links, the Hypertext Markup Language (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?>), and the arrival of a graphical browser, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mosaic', 'WB'); ?>, the Web quickly transcended Gopher.</p>
        <p>Gopher was developed at the University of Minnesota, whose sports teams are called "the Golden Gophers".</p>
        <p>Although most Gopher browsers and files are text-based, Gopher browsers, notably HyperGopher, were developed that displayed graphic images (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GIF', 'IT'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JPEG', 'IT'); ?> files) that were included in Gopher file directories.</p>
        <p>Two tools for searching Gopher file hierarchies were Veronica and Jughead.</p>
