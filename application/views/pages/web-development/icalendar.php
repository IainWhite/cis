        <p><strong>iCalendar</strong> is a computer file format which allows Internet users to send meeting requests and tasks to other Internet users, via email, or sharing files with an extension of <code>.ics</code>. Recipients of the iCalendar data file (with supporting software, such as an email client or calendar application) can respond to the sender easily or counter propose another meeting date / time.</p>
        <p>iCalendar is used and supported by a large number of products, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google Calendar', 'URL'); ?>, Apple Calendar (formerly <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iCal', 'ITS'); ?>), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM Lotus Notes', 'ITS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Yahoo! Calendar', 'URL'); ?>, Evolution (software), eM Client, Lightning extension for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Thunderbird', 'ITS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SeaMonkey', 'WB'); ?>, and partially by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Outlook', 'ITS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Novell GroupWise', 'ITS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>iCalendar is designed to be independent of the transport protocol. For example, certain events can be sent by traditional email or whole calendar files can be shared and edited by using a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebDAV', 'WD'); ?> server, or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SyncML', 'WD'); ?>. Simple Web servers (using just the HTTP protocol) are often used to distribute iCalendar data about an event and to publish busy times of an individual. Publishers can embed iCalendar data in web pages using <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('hCalendar', 'WD'); ?>, a 1:1 microformat representation of iCalendar in semantic (X)HTML.</p>
