        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('SeaMonkey Internet Suite'); ?>
        <p><strong>SeaMonkey</strong> is a free and open-source Internet suite.</p>
        <p>It is the continuation of the former <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Application Suite', 'WB'); ?>, based on the same source code.</p>
        <p>The development of SeaMonkey is community-driven, in contrast to the Mozilla Application Suite, which until its last released version (1.7.13) was governed by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Foundation', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The new project-leading group is the <strong>SeaMonkey Council</strong>.</p>
        <p>The SeaMonkey Council, which is the team responsible for project and release management, currently consists of Philip Chee, Karsten DÃ¼sterloh, Jens Hatlak, Robert Kaiser, Ian Neal, Neil Rashbrook, Andrew Schultz and Justin Wood.</p>
        <p>On 10 March 2005, the Mozilla Foundation announced that it would not release any official versions of Mozilla Application Suite beyond 1.7.x, since it had now focused on the standalone applications <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox', 'WB'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Thunderbird', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>However, the Foundation emphasized that it would still provide infrastructure for community members who wished to continue development.</p>
        <p>In effect, this meant that the suite would still continue to be developed, but now by the SeaMonkey Council instead of the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
        <p>The first release of SeaMonkey happened on 15 September 2005.</p>
        <p>SeaMonkey 1 was released on 30 January 2006.</p>
        <p>To avoid confusing organizations that still want to use the original Mozilla Suite, the new product needed a new name.</p>
        <p>After initial speculation by members of the community, a 2 July 2005 announcement confirmed that <strong>SeaMonkey</strong> would officially become the name of the Internet suite superseding the Mozilla Suite.</p>
        <p>"<em>Seamonkey</em>" was formerly used (but with lowercase m) by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Netscape', 'C'); ?> and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Foundation', 'C'); ?> as a code name for the never-released "Netscape Communicator 5" and later the Mozilla Suite itself.</p>
        <p>Originally, the name derived from needing a nicer word instead of <em>ButtMonkey</em> winning a contest for it and chosen with reference to brine shrimp.</p>
        <p>The SeaMonkey Council has now trademarked the name with help from the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
        <p>The project uses a separate numbering scheme, with the first release being called SeaMonkey 1.0.</p>
        <p>Despite having a different name and version number, SeaMonkey 1.0 is based on the same code as Mozilla Suite 1.8.</p>
