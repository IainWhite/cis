        <p><strong>MacWWW</strong>, also known as <strong>Samba</strong>, is an early minimalist <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> from 1992 meant to run on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> computers.</p>
        <p>It was the first web browser for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?> platform, and the first for any non-Unix operating system.</p>
        <p>MacWWW tries to emulate the design of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WorldWideWeb', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It was written at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CERN', 'C'); ?> by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Robert Calliau', 'P'); ?> and later <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Nicola Pellow', 'P'); ?> helped with the development.</p>
        <p>Pellow worked original on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Line Mode Browser', 'WB'); ?> and both browsers shared some parts of the source code after her switching.</p>
