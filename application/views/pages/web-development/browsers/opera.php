        <p><strong>Opera</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> developed by <strong>Opera Software</strong>.</p>
        <p>Opera uses the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Blink', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engine', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Opera runs on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> operating systems.</p>
        <p>Users of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> must install earlier versions which have the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Presto', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> layout engine.</p>
        <p>Opera editions are available for devices running the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?>, Symbian, Maemo, Bada, BlackBerry and Windows Mobile operating systems, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java ME', 'LJ'); ?>.</p>
        <p>According to Opera Software, the browser had more than 350 million users worldwide (more than 270 million users with mobile versions) on December 2013.</p>
        <p>Opera has been noted for originating many features later adopted by other web browsers. A prominent example is <strong>Speed Dial</strong>.</p>
        <p>Opera began in 1994 as a research project at <strong>Telenor</strong>, the largest Norwegian telecommunications company.</p>
        <p>In 1995, it branched out into a separate company named Opera Software ASA.</p>
        <p>Opera was first released publicly with version 2.0 in 1996, which only ran on Microsoft Windows.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to capitalize on the emerging market for Internet-connected hand-held devices, a project to port Opera to mobile device platforms was started in 1998.</p>
        <p>Opera 4.0, released in 2000, included a new cross-platform core that facilitated creation of editions of Opera for multiple operating systems and platforms.</p>
        <p>Up to this point, Opera was trialware and had to be purchased after the trial period ended. Version 5.0 (released in 2000) saw the end of this requirement.</p>
        <p>Instead, Opera became ad-sponsored, displaying advertisements to users who had not paid for it. Later versions of Opera gave the user the choice of seeing banner ads or targeted text advertisements from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>With version 8.5 (released in 2005) the advertisements were removed entirely and primary financial support for the browser came through revenue from Google (which is by contract Opera's default search engine).</p>
        <p>Among the new features introduced in version 9.1 (released in 2006) was fraud protection using technology from GeoTrust, a digital certificate provider, and PhishTank, an organization that tracks known phishing web sites.</p>
        <p>This feature was further improved and expanded in version 9.5, when GeoTrust was replaced with Netcraft, and malware protection from Haute Secure was added.</p>
        <p>Also in 2006, Opera Software ASA released <strong>Internet Channel</strong> and <strong>Nintendo DS Browser</strong> for <strong>Nintendo's DS</strong> and <strong>Wii</strong> gaming systems.</p>
        <p>A new {'JavaScript engine'|link_urls:'w'} called <strong>Carakan</strong>, after the Javanese alphabet, was introduced with version 10.50.</p>
        <p>According to Opera Software, Carakan makes Opera 10.50 more than seven times faster in SunSpider than Opera 10.10.</p>
        <p>On 16 December 2010, Opera 11 was released, featuring extensions, tab stacking, visual mouse gestures, and changes to the address bar.</p>
        <p>Opera 12 was released on 14 June 2012.</p>
        <p>On 12 February 2013, Opera announced it would drop its own Presto engine in favour of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> as implemented by Google's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chrome', 'WB'); ?> browser, using code from the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chromium', 'WB'); ?> project.</p>
        <p>Opera Software also planned to contribute code to WebKit.</p>
        <p>On 3 April 2013, Google announced that it would fork components from WebKit to form a new rendering engine known as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Blink', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?>; the same day, Opera confirmed that it would follow Google in implementing Blink.</p>
        <p>On 28 May 2013, a beta release of Opera 15 was made available, the first version based on the Chromium project.</p>
        <p>Many distinctive features of the previous versions were dropped, and Opera Mail was separated into a standalone application derived from Opera 12.</p>
