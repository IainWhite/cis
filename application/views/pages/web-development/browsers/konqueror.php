        <p><strong>Konqueror</strong> is a free and open-source <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> and file manager that provides file viewer functionality for file systems such as local files, files on a remote <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FTP', 'IPA'); ?> server and files in a disk image.</p>
        <p>It is a core part of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KDE', 'C'); ?> Software Compilation.</p>
        <p>Konqueror is developed by volunteers and can run on most <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> like operating systems and on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> systems.</p>
        <p>Konqueror is licensed and distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.</p>
        <p>The name "<strong><em>Konqueror</em></strong>" is a reference to the two primary competitors at the time of the browser's first release: "<em>first comes the Navigator, then Explorer, and then the Konqueror</em>".</p>
        <p>It also follows the KDE naming convention: the names of most KDE programs begin with the letter <em>K</em>.</p>
        <p>Konqueror was released with version 2 of KDE on 23 October 2000. It replaces its predecessor, <strong>KFM</strong> (KDE file manager).</p>
        <p>With the release of KDE4, Konqueror was replaced as the default file manager by Dolphin.</p>
