        <p><strong>WorldWideWeb</strong> (later renamed to <strong>Nexus</strong> to avoid confusion between the software and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?> ) was the first <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?>  and editor.</p>
        <p>When it was written, WorldWideWeb was the only way to view the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web', 'WD'); ?> .</p>
        <p>The source code was released into the public domain in 1991. Some of the code still resides on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Tim Berners-Lee', 'P'); ?> 's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NeXT', 'ITH'); ?>  Computer in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CERN', 'C'); ?>  museum and has not been recovered due to the computer's status as a historical artefact.</p>
        <p>To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the research centre giving the web to the world, a project has begun at CERN to preserve this original hardware and software associated with the birth of the web.</p>
        <p>Berners-Lee wrote WorldWideWeb on a NeXT Computer during the second half of 1990, while working for CERN.</p>
        <p>The first successful build was completed on 25 December 1990, after only two months of development.</p>
        <p>Successive builds circulated among Berners-Lee's colleagues at CERN before being released to the public, by way of Internet newsgroups, in August 1991.</p>
        <p>By this time, several others, including Bernd Pollermann, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Robert Calliau', 'P'); ?> , Jean-Fran√ßois Groff, and graduate student <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Nicola Pellow', 'P'); ?>  were involved in the project.</p>
        <p>The team created so called "passive browsers" which do not have the editing prospects because it was hard to port the ability to edit pages like on the NeXT system to other operating systems.</p>
        <p>The port to the X Window System was not possible as nobody on the team had experience with X.</p>
        <p>Berners-Lee and Groff later adapted many of WorldWideWeb's components into a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?>  programming language version, creating the <strong>libwww API</strong>.</p>
        <p>A number of early browsers appeared, notably <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ViolaWWW', 'WB'); ?> . They were all eclipsed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mosaic', 'WB'); ?>  in terms of popularity, which by 1993 had replaced the WorldWideWeb program.</p>
        <p>On 30 April 1993, the CERN directorate released the source code of WorldWideWeb into the public domain.</p>
        <p>Berners-Lee proposed different names for his new application: <em>The Mine of Information</em> and <em>The Information Mesh</em> were proposals.</p>
        <p>At the end WorldWideWeb was chosen, but later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion between the World Wide Web and the web browser.</p>
