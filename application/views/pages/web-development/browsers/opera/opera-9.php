        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Opera 9 Web Browser'); ?>
        <p>Version 9.0 was the first <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BSD', 'OS'); ?> browser to pass the <strong>Acid2</strong> test.</p>
        <p>This version, released on 20 June 2006, added <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XSLT', 'WD'); ?> and improved SVG to 1.1 Basic level.</p>
        <p>Beta versions of Opera 9 included an Easter egg that, when triggered, affects the Acid2 test.</p>
        <p>After the page has been open for a while, the eyes of the smiley will follow the cursor around and when the user clicks on the eyes, a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> alert will read "<em>Because just passing is not enough ;)</em>".</p>
        <p>The changes to the Acid2 code were applied using Opera's <code>browser.js</code> feature, and remain available in a separate User JavaScript file.</p>
        <p>Opera introduced Widgets, small web applications, a built-in BitTorrent client, improved content blocking and a built-in tool for creating and editing search engines.</p>
        <p>Opera also added ability to read <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MHTML', 'WD'); ?> and to save the web page as archives.</p>
        <p>Version 9.1 (released in 2006) introduced fraud protection using technology from GeoTrust, a digital certificate provider, and PhishTank, an organization that tracks known phishing web sites.</p>
        <p>Version 9.2, codenamed <em>Merlin</em>, introduced Speed Dial, 3x3 small thumbnails which are shown instead of a blank page.</p>
        <p>Version 9.5, codenamed <em>Kestrel</em> (after the Kestrel falcon), was released to span the gap between Opera 9.2 and Opera 10.</p>
        <p>It included some of the rendering improvements due to be made in Opera 10 and also aimed to provide better integration with various operating systems.</p>
        <p>The first alpha build of Opera 9.5 was released on 4 September 2007.</p>
        <p>The first public beta was released on 25 October 2007, and the final version was released on 12 June 2008.</p>
        <p>The final release was downloaded more than 4.5 million times in the first 5 days.</p>
        <p>Opera 9.5 has improved support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), including many more <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS-3', 'WD'); ?> selectors and the CSS2 text-shadow property.</p>
        <p>Support for other web standards was also improved. For example, Opera 9.5's Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) implementation supports 93.8% of the W3C's SVG test suite, and built-in support for Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) and MathML.</p>
        <p>Opera 9.5 also supports high-security Extended Validation Certificates and added malware protection through partnership with Haute Secure.</p>
        <p>The interface underwent a few alterations as well. Using "Sharp" by default, a new skin designed to be more intuitive, though the classic skin was still available as a user preference.</p>
        <p>Screen reader support has been added back in. Opera's mail client, Opera Mail, has been updated, with an improved indexing feature and many bugfixes.</p>
        <p>Opera 9.5 also lets users save bookmarks, notes, the Personal Bar and Speed Dial settings to the Opera Link service.</p>
        <p>These preferences can then be synchronized with another Opera browser, such as a copy of Opera Mini running on a mobile phone.</p>
        <p>Alongside the new features, Opera 9.5 had new performance improvements. For example, x64-bit editions of Opera for compatible Linux and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BSD', 'OS'); ?> operating systems. On the other hand, SPARC Linux support has been dropped.</p>
        <p>Version 9.6 improved Opera Link with the new opportunity to sync custom search engines and typed history. Feed preview and an updated Opera Mail client were additional changes.</p>
