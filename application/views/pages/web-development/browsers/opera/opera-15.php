        <p>On 12 February 2013, Opera Software announced their intention to transition from their <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Presto', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engine', 'WD'); ?> to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?>, building upon the base of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chromium', 'WB'); ?> project.</p>
        <p>After the announcement of transition from WebKit to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Blink', 'web-developer/layout-engines'); ?> by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>, Opera confirmed it would also switch to Blink instead of WebKit.</p>
        <p>The version identifier 13 was skipped, thought to be for reasons of superstition, while 14 was used to refer to a WebKit based release of Opera for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>On 28 May 2013, a beta version of Opera 15 containing Blink was made available for Windows and Mac computers.</p>
        <p>It removed many distinctive Opera features, including some ubiquitous features like bookmarks (with an expanded Speed Dial intended to replace this feature).</p>
        <p>The features confirmed to be restored in the near future were synchronization, theme support, geolocation, and a "feature rich" tab bar.</p>
        <p>The previously-bundled M2 email client was released as a standalone application, Opera Mail.</p>
        <p>Extensions for the previous browser versions are no longer supported; instead developers are provided facilities for converting old extensions to Chrome extensions, supported in Opera 15.</p>
        <p>On 2 July 2013, the final version of Opera 15.0 was released. This release was not pushed through the automatic update system, as it was deemed some features important to current users had yet to be implemented.</p>
