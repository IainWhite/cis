        <p>On 19 April 2005, version 8.0 was released.</p>
        <p>Besides supporting SVG Tiny, multimodal features and User JavaScript, the default user interface was cleaned up and simplified.</p>
        <p>The default home page was an improved search portal.</p>
        <p>The changes displeased a number of existing users since some advanced settings became hidden.</p>
        <p>Version 8.0 introduced support for <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SVG', 'WD'); ?>) 1.1 Tiny. This marked the first major web browser to natively support some form of SVG.</p>
        <p>Version 8.5 was released on 20 September 2005.</p>
        <p>Opera announced that their browser would be available free of charge and without advertisements, although the company still continued to sell support contracts.</p>
        <p>Enhancements included automatic client-side fixing of web sites that did not render correctly, and a number of security fixes.</p>
