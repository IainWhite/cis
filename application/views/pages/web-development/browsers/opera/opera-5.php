        <p>Opera 5, released on 6 December 2000, was the first version which was ad-sponsored instead of having a trial period.</p>
        <p>Version 5 also supported <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ICQ', 'WD'); ?>, but this was dropped from later versions.</p>
        <p>Opera supported <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?> for the first time, requiring WarpIN and Odin to be installed.</p>
        <p>Opera 5.10 (April 2001) was the first version to recognize mouse gestures, but this feature was disabled by default.</p>
