        <p>Version 10 (<em>Peregrine</em>) debuted in a first beta version on 3 June 2009 and scored 100/100 on the <strong>Acid3</strong> test, but failed the smoothness criteria.</p>
        <p>There was also a preview build that scored 100/100, released on 28 March 2009.</p>
        <p>Among other features, it also came with speed optimizations, in-line spell checking for forms, an auto update feature, HTML mail formatting, web fonts and SVG font support, alpha transparency support using the RGBA and HSLA colour models, and an updated version of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Opera Dragonfly', 'WD'); ?> web debugger.</p>
        <p><strong>Opera Turbo</strong>, a mode which uses Opera's servers as proxy servers with data compression, reducing volume of data transferred by up to 80% (depending upon content), and thus increasing speed, was introduced.</p>
        <p>Opera 10 was officially released on 1 September 2009. Within a week of release, 10 million downloads had been recorded.</p>
        <p>The 10.5x versions (codenamed <em>Evenes</em>) also came with a new JavaScript engine, <strong>Carakan</strong>, and a new graphics back-end dubbed <strong>Vega</strong> (replacing the previously used Qt), that have increased its speed measurably.</p>
        <p>Then version 10.60, which Opera Software claims to be 50% faster than Opera 10.50, which also brought up new features like Geolocation, WebM support, AVG malware protection, Speed Dial improvements, etc.</p>
