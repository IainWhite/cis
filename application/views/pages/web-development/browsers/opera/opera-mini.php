        <p><strong>Opera Mini</strong> is a micro-browser designed primarily for mobile phones, but also for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('smartphones', 'IT'); ?> and personal digital assistants.</p>
        <p>Versions up to 4 used the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java Me', 'LJ'); ?> platform, requiring the mobile device to be capable of running Java ME applications.</p>
        <p>The micro-browser began as a pilot project in 2005.</p>
        <p>After limited releases in Europe, it was officially launched worldwide on 24 January 2006.</p>
        <p>Opera Mini requests web pages through the Opera Software company's servers, which process and compress them before relaying the pages back to the mobile phone.</p>
        <p>This compression process reduces data transferred by up to 90% (depending upon content), increasing loading speed, and the pre-processing smooths compatibility with web pages not designed for mobile phones.</p>
