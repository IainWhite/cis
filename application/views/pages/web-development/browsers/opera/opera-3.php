        <p><strong>Opera 3</strong> was the first version of Opera with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> support, but <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> was still missing.</p>
        <p>It was released for multiple operating systems on 31 December 1997.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Opera 3.5 was released, adding <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?>)</strong> support and file upload capability.</p>
        <p>Since version 3.5, Opera has supported CSS, and <strong>HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</strong>, one of the inventors of CSS, is the CTO at Opera.</p>
        <p>Up to 6.0 Opera supported most common web standards, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Netscape', 'WB'); ?> plugins and some other recent standards such as WAP and WML for wireless devices, but its implementation of advanced <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ECMAScript', 'JS'); ?> (better known as "JavaScript") and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> Document Object Model (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?>) was poor.</p>
        <p>Version 3.6 was released on 12 May 1999.</p>
