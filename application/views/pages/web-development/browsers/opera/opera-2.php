        <p>Version 2.0, the first public release of Opera, was released as shareware in 1996.</p>
        <p>Due to popular demand, Opera Software showed interest in programming its browser for alternate operating systems such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?>, QNX and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BeOS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>On 10 October 1997, they launched "<em>Project Magic</em>", an effort to determine who would be willing to purchase a copy of their browser in their native OS, and to properly distribute funds to develop or outsource for such operating systems.</p>
        <p>On 30 November 1997 they closed voting for which operating system to develop with. Project Magic then became a news column for updates for alternate operating systems until version 4.</p>
