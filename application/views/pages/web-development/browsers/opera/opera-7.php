        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Opera 7 Web Browser'); ?>
        <p>On 28 January 2003, Opera 7 was released, introducing the new "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Presto', 'web-development/layout-engine'); ?>" <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engine', 'WD'); ?>, with improved <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?>, client-side scripting, and Document Object Model (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?>) support. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS 9', 'OS'); ?> support was dropped.</p>
        <p>Version 7.0 saw Opera undergo an extensive rewrite with the faster and more powerful Presto layout engine.</p>
        <p>The new engine brought almost full support for the HTML DOM meaning that parts of, or a whole, page can be re-rendered in response to DOM and script events.</p>
        <p>A 2004 review in The Washington Post described Opera 7.5 as being excessively complex and difficult to use.</p>
        <p>The review also criticized the free edition's use of obtrusive advertisements when other browsers such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla', 'WB'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari', 'WB'); ?> were offered free of charge without including advertisements.</p>
        <p>In August 2004, Opera 7.6 began limited alpha testing. It had more advanced standards support, and introduced voice support for Opera, as well as support for Voice XML.</p>
        <p>Opera also announced a new browser for Interactive Television, which included a fit to width option Opera 8 introduced.</p>
        <p>Fit to Width is a technology that initially utilized the power of CSS, but it is now internal Opera technology.</p>
        <p>Pages are dynamically resized by making images and/or text smaller, and even removing images with specific dimensions to make it fit on any screen width, improving the experience on smaller screens dramatically.</p>
        <p>Opera 7.6 was never officially released as a final version.</p>
        <p>On 12 January 2005, Opera Software announced that it would offer free licenses to higher education institutions, a change from the previous cost of $1,000 USD for unlimited licenses.</p>
        <p>Schools that opted for the free license included Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, University of Oxford, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Duke University.</p>
        <p>Opera was commonly criticized for having been ad-sponsored, since this was seen as a barrier to gaining market share.</p>
        <p>In the newer versions the user was allowed a choice of generic graphical banners, or text-based targeted advertisements provided by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> based upon the page being viewed.</p>
        <p>Users could pay a license fee to remove the advertisement bar.</p>
