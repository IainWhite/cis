        <p><strong>Opera Dragonfly</strong> is a full-featured development and debugging tool integrated into the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Opera', 'WB'); ?> web browser.</p>
        <p>It supports debugging <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?>, viewing the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?>, monitoring network traffic, previewing resources, editing colours, etc.</p>
        <p>Opera Dragonfly also supports remote debugging, which allows using the features of Dragonfly to be used when debugging a mobile phone, TV, or another desktop computer.</p>
        <p>Using Opera Dragonfly for the first time requires an Internet connection to download Opera Dragonfly files. Then, Opera Dragonfly can be loaded offline from Opera's cache.</p>
        <p>Opera Dragonfly automatically updates to the latest version available, when connected to the Internet.</p>
        <p>Opera Dragonfly is compatible with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Presto', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> 2.1 and later, specifically Opera Mobile 9.5 and above, Opera Desktop 9.5 and above, and <strong>Nintendo DS</strong> and <strong>Nintendo DSi</strong> Browser.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Scope transport protocol (STP)</strong> is used for communication between the Opera browser and Opera Dragonfly.</p>
        <p>Development of Opera Dragonfly started in May 2008. When the development started Opera Dragonfly was using the BSD license, but later on it was changed to the Apache License 2.0.</p>
        <p>On 21 September 2011, the Opera Dragonfly team announced that from now on releases will be more focused on improvements to individual components, e.g. the DOM inspector or the UI framework.</p>
        <p>As soon as a feature for a certain component has been implemented, it will be put on the experimental path for some initial testing.</p>
