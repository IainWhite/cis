        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('IE4 - Internet Explorer 4'); ?>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4</strong>, released in September 1997, deepened the level of integration between the web browser and the underlying operating system.</p>
        <p>Installing version 4 on a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIn'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT 4', 'WIN'); ?> machine and choosing Windows Desktop Update would result in the traditional Windows Explorer being replaced by a version more akin to a web browser interface, as well as the Windows desktop itself being web-enabled via <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Active Desktop', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The integration with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>, however, was subject to numerous packaging criticisms.</p>
        <p>This option was no longer available with the installers for later versions of Internet Explorer, but was not removed from the system if already installed.</p>
        <p>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 introduced support for Group Policy, allowing companies to configure and lock down many aspects of the browser's configuration as well as support for off-line browsing.</p>
        <p>Internet Mail and News was replaced with Outlook Express, and Microsoft Chat and an improved NetMeeting were also included.</p>
        <p>This version was also included with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 98', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 offered new features such as easier 128-bit encryption.</p>
