        <p><strong>Microsoft Internet Explorer 7</strong> was released on 18 October 2006.</p>
        <p>It includes bug fixes, enhancements to its support for web standards, tabbed browsing with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine search box, a web feeds reader, Internationalized Domain Name support (IDN), Extended Validation Certificate support, and an anti-phishing filter.</p>
        <p>With IE7, Internet Explorer has been decoupled from the Windows Shell unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ActiveX', 'WD'); ?> control is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather runs in a separate Internet Explorer process.</p>
        <p>It is included with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Vista', 'WIN'); ?> and Windows Server 2008, and is available for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows XP', 'WIN'); ?> Service Pack 2 and later, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and later.</p>
        <p>The original release of Internet Explorer 7 required the computer to pass a <strong>Windows Genuine Advantage validation</strong> check prior to installing, but on 5 October 2007, Microsoft removed this requirement.</p>
