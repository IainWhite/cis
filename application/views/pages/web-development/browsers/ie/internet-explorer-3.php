        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Internet Explorer 3</strong> was released on 13 August 1996 and went on to be much more popular than its predecessors.<p>
        <p>Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 was the first major browser with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?> support, although this support was only partial.</p>
        <p>It also introduced support for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ActiveX', 'WD'); ?> controls, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java applets', 'WD'); ?>, in-line multimedia, and the PICS system for content metadata.</p>
        <p>Version 3 also came bundled with Internet Mail and News, NetMeeting, and an early version of the Windows Address Book, and was itself included with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'OS'); ?> OSR 2.</p>
        <p>Version 3 proved to be the first more popular version of Internet Explorer, bringing with it increased scrutiny.</p>
        <p>In the months following its release, a number of security and privacy vulnerabilities were found by researchers and hackers.</p>
        <p>The first major IE security hole, the <strong>Princeton Word Macro Virus Loophole</strong>, was discovered on 22 August 1996 in IE3.</p>
        <p>The Internet Explorer team consisted of roughly 100 people during the development of three months.</p>
        <p>This version of Internet Explorer was the first to have the 'blue e' logo.</p>
