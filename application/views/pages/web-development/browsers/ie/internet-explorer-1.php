        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Internet Explorer</strong> (later referred to as <strong>Internet Explorer 1</strong>) made its debut on 16 August 1995.</p>
        <p>It was a reworked version of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Spyglass Mosaic', 'WB'); ?> which Microsoft had licensed, like many other companies initiating browser development, from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Spyglass Inc', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It came with <strong>Microsoft Plus! for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?></strong> and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OEM', 'IT'); ?> release of Windows 95.</p>
        <p>It was installed as part of the <strong>Internet Jumpstart Kit</strong> in Plus! for Windows 95.</p>
        <p>The Internet Explorer team began with about six people in early development.</p>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Internet Explorer 1.5</strong> was released several months later for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT', 'WIN'); ?> and added support for basic <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> <code>table</code> rendering.</p>
        <p>By including it free of charge on their operating system, they did not have to pay royalties to Spyglass Inc, resulting in a lawsuit and a US$8 million settlement on 22 January 1997.</p>
        <p>Although not included, this software can also be installed on the original release of Windows 95.</p>
