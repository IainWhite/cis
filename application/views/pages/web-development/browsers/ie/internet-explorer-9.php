        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('IE9 - Internet Explorer 9'); ?>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Internet Explorer 9</strong> was released on 14 March 2011.</p>
        <p>Development for Internet Explorer 9 began shortly after the release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 8', 'IE'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Microsoft first announced Internet Explorer 9 at PDC 2009, and spoke mainly about how it takes advantage of hardware acceleration in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DirectX', 'WD'); ?> to improve the performance of web applications and quality of web typography.</p>
        <p>The first public beta was released at a special event in San Francisco, which was themed around "<em>the beauty of the web</em>".</p>
        <p>The release candidate was released on 10 February 2011, and featured improved performance, refinements to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UI', 'IT'); ?>, and further standards support.</p>
        <p>The final version was released during the South by Southwest music and film festival in Austin, Texas, on 14 March 2011.</p>
        <p>Internet Explorer 9 is only supported on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Vista', 'WIN'); ?> SP2, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 7', 'WIN'); ?>, and Windows Server 2008.</p>
        <p>It supports several <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS-3', 'WD'); ?> properties (including border-radius, box-shadow, etc.), and embedded ICC v2 or v4 colour profiles support via Windows Color System.</p>
        <p>The 32-bit version has faster <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> performance, this being due to a new <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> called "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chakra', 'web-development/javascript/engines'); ?>".</p>
        <p>It also features hardware accelerated graphics rendering using Direct2D, hardware-accelerated text rendering using DirectWrite, hardware-accelerated video rendering using Media Foundation, imaging support provided by Windows Imaging Component, and high fidelity printing powered by the XPS print pipeline.</p>
        <p>IE9 also supports the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML5', 'WD'); ?> video and audio tags and the Web Open Font Format.</p>
        <p>Internet Explorer was to be omitted from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 in Europe, but Microsoft ultimately included it, with a browser option screen allowing users to select any of several web browsers (including Internet Explorer).</p>
