        <p><strong>Microsoft Internet Explorer 6</strong> was released on 27 August 2001, a few months before <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows XP', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>This version included <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DHTML', 'WD'); ?> enhancements, content restricted in-line frames, and partial support of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?> level 1, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?> level 1, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SMIL', 'WD'); ?> 2.0.</p>

        <p>Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 offered several security enhancements and coincided with the Windows XP SP1 patch release.</p>
        <p>In 2002, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Gopher', 'IPA'); ?> protocol was disabled, and support for it was dropped in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 7', 'IE'); ?>.</p>
