        <p>Internet Explorer for Mac</strong> (also referred to as <strong>Internet Explorer for Macintosh</strong>, <strong>Internet Explorer Macintosh Edition</strong>, <strong>Internet Explorer:mac</strong> or <strong>IE:mac</strong>) was a proprietary <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> platform.</p>
        <p>Initial versions were developed from the same code base as Internet Explorer for Windows. Later versions diverged, particularly with the release of version 5 which included the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Tasman', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engine', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>As a result of the five-year agreement between <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> in 1997, it was the default browser on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> from 1998 until it was replaced by Apple's own <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari', 'WB'); ?> web browser in 2003 with the release of Mac OS X 10.3 Panther.</p>
        <p>On June 13, 2003, Microsoft announced that it was ceasing further development of Internet Explorer for Mac and the final update was released on 11 July 2003.</p>
        <p>The browser was not included in the default installation of Mac OS X v10.4 "Tiger" which was released on 29 April 2005.</p>
        <p>Microsoft discontinued support for the product on 31 December 2005 and removed the application from their Macintosh downloads site on 31 January 2006.</p>
        <p>Microsoft recommended "<em>that users migrate to more recent web browsing technologies such as Apple's Safari</em>".</p>
