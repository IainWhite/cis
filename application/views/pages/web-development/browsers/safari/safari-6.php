        <p><strong>Safari 6.0</strong> was previously known as Safari 5.2 until <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> announced the change at WWDC 2012.</p>
        <p>The stable release of Safari 6 coincided with the release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X Mountain Lion', 'OSX'); ?> on 25 July 2012, and is integrated into the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('O/S', 'IT'); ?>.</p>
        <p>As Apple integrated it with Mountain Lion, it is no longer available for download from the Apple website or other sources.</p>
        <p>Apple released Safari 6 via Software Update for users of OS X Lion.</p>
        <p>It has not been released for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> versions prior to Lion or for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Regarding the unavailability of Safari 6 on Windows, Apple has stated "<em>Safari 6 is available for Mountain Lion and Lion. Safari 5 continues to be available for Windows</em>". <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> removed Safari from its BrowserChoice page.</p>
        <p>On 11 June 2012, Apple released a developer preview of Safari 6.0 with a feature called iCloud Tabs, which allows users to 'sync' their open tabs with any <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> or other OS X device running the latest software.</p>
        <p>Safari 6 also included new privacy features, including an "Ask websites not to track me" preference, and the ability for websites to send <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion', 'OSX'); ?> users notifications, although it removed <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RSS', 'WD'); ?> support.</p>
        <p>Safari 6 has the Share Sheets capability in OS X Mountain Lion.</p>
        <p>The Share Sheet options are: Add to Reading List, Add Bookmark, Email this Page, Message, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Twitter', 'URL'); ?> and Facebook<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Facebook', 'URL'); ?>. Users can now see tabs with full page previews available.</p>
