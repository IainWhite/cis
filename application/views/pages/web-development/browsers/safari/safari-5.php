        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Safari 5'); ?>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> released <strong>Safari 5</strong> on 7 June 2010, featuring the new Safari Reader for reading articles on the web without distraction (based on Arc90's Readability tool), and a 30 percent <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> performance increase over <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari 4', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Safari 5 includes improved developer tools and supports more than a dozen new <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML5', 'WB'); ?> technologies, focused on interoperability.</p>
        <p>With Safari 5, developers can now create secure <strong>Safari Extensions</strong> to customize and enhance the browsing experience.</p>
        <p>Apple also re-added the progress bar behind the address bar in this release.</p>
        <p>Safari 5.0.1 enabled the Extensions PrefPane by default; previously, users had to enable it via the Debug menu.</p>
        <p>Apple also released Safari 4.1 concurrently with Safari 5, exclusively for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X Tiger', 'OSX'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The update included the majority of the features and security enhancements found in Safari 5.</p>
        <p>It did not, however, include Safari Reader or Safari Extensions.</p>
        <p>Together with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X 10.7 Lion', 'OSX'); ?>, Apple released Safari 5.1 for both <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac', 'ITH'); ?> on 20 July 2011, with the new function 'Reading List' and a faster browsing experience.</p>
        <p>Apple simultaneously released Safari 5.0.6 for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard', 'OSX'); ?>, excluding Leopard users from the new functions in Safari 5.1.</p>
