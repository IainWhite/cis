        <p>On 2 June 2008, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> development team announced <strong>SquirrelFish</strong>, a new <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> that vastly improves Safari's speed at interpreting scripts.</p>
        <p>The engine is one of the new features in <strong>Safari 4</strong>, released to developers on 11 June 2008.</p>
        <p>The new JavaScript engine quickly evolved into <strong>SquirrelFish Extreme</strong>, featuring even further improved performance over SquirrelFish, and was eventually marketed as <strong>Nitro</strong>.</p>
        <p>A public beta of Safari 4 was released on 24 February 2009, with new features such as the Top Sites tool (similar to Opera's Speed Dial feature), which displays the user's most visited sites on a 3D wall.</p>
        <p>Cover Flow, a feature of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iTunes', 'IT'); ?>, was also implemented in Safari.</p>
        <p>In the public beta versions, tabs were placed in the title bar of the window, similar to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google Chrome', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The tab bar was moved back to its original location, below the URL bar, in the final release.</p>
        <p>The Windows version adopted a native Windows theme, rather than the previously employed Mac OS X style interface.</p>
        <p>Also Apple removed the blue progress bar located in the address bar (later reinstated in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari 5', 'WB'); ?>).</p>
        <p>Safari 4.0.1 was released for Mac on 17 June and fixed problems with Faces in iPhoto '09.</p>
        <p>Safari 4 in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS S v10.6', 'OSX'); ?> "Snow Leopard" has <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('64-bit', 'IT'); ?> support, which can make <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> loading up to 50% faster.</p>
        <p>It also has built-in crash resistance unique to Snow Leopard; crash resistance will keep the browser intact if a plug-in like <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Flash player', 'ITS'); ?> crashes, such that the other tabs or windows will be unaffected.</p>
        <p>Safari 4.0.4, released on 11 November 2009 for both <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>, further improves JavaScript performance.</p>
