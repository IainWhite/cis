        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Safari 8'); ?>
        <p><strong>Safari 8</strong> was announced at WWDC 2014 and released with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X Yosemite', 'OSX'); ?>. It included WebGL support, stronger privacy features, increased speed and efficiency, enhanced iCloud integration, and updated design.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>WebGL support, which allows developers to create 3D experiences that work natively in the browser.</li>
            <li>IndexedDB, which allows web developers to store structured data for web applications that work online or require large amounts of data to be cached client side.</li>
            <li>JavaScript Promises, which enables JavaScript authors to more naturally work with asynchronous programming patterns.</li>
            <li>CSS Shapes and Compositing. Using CSS, websites can now easily flow text around images and geometry shapes, and perform image compositing operations on DOM elements.</li>
            <li>SPDY. Safari supports SPDY, an open networking protocol that websites can adopt to reduce page load latency and improve security.</li>
            <li>HTML5 Premium Video. Websites that provide video can now take advantage of EME to deliver encrypted, energy-efficient video in the browser</li>
        </ul>
