        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Safari 3'); ?>
        <p>On 9 January 2007, at Macworld SF, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Jobs', 'P'); ?> announced <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?>, which would use a mobile version of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari', 'WB'); ?> browser.</p>
        <p>On 11 June 2007, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Jobs announced <strong>Safari 3</strong> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X v10.5', 'OSX'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows XP', 'WIN'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Vista', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>During the announcement, he ran a benchmark based on the <strong>iBench</strong> browser test suite comparing the most popular Windows browsers, hence claiming that Safari was the fastest browser.</p>
        <p>Later third-party tests of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTTP', 'IPA'); ?> load times would support Apple's claim that Safari 3 was indeed the fastest browser on the Windows platform in terms of initial data loading over the Internet, though it was found to be only negligibly faster than <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 7', 'IE'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Firefox', 'WB'); ?> when loading static content from local cache.</p>
        <p>The initial Safari 3 beta version for Windows, released on the same day as its announcement at WWDC 2007, had several known bugs and a zero day exploit that allowed remote execution.</p>
        <p>The addressed bugs were then corrected by Apple three days later on 14 June 2007, in version 3.0.1 for Windows.</p>
        <p>On 22 June 2007, Apple released Safari 3.0.2 to address some bugs, performance issues and other security issues.</p>
        <p>Safari 3.0.2 for Windows handles some fonts that are missing in the browser but already installed on Windows computers, such as Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, and others.</p>
        <p>The iPhone was formally released on 29 June 2007. It includes a version of Safari based on the same WebKit rendering engine as the desktop version, but with a modified feature set better suited for a mobile device.</p>
        <p>The version number of Safari as reported in its user agent string is 3.0, in line with the contemporary desktop versions of Safari.</p>
        <p>The first stable, non-beta release of Safari for Windows, Safari 3.1, was offered as a free download on 18 March 2008.</p>
        <p>In June 2008, Apple released version 3.1.2, addressing a security vulnerability in the Windows version where visiting a malicious web site could force a download of executable files and execute them on the user's desktop.</p>
        <p>Safari 3.2, released on 13 November 2008, introduced anti-phishing features and Extended Validation Certificate support.</p>
        <p>The final version of Safari 3 is 3.2.3, released on 12 May 2009.</p>
