        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Safari 2'); ?>
        <p>In April 2005, Dave Hyatt, one of the Safari developers at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>, documented his study by fixing specific bugs in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari', 'WB'); ?>, thereby enabling it to pass the Acid2 test developed by the Web Standards Project.</p>
        <p>On 27 April 2005, he announced that his development version of Safari now passed the test, making it the first web browser to do so.</p>
        <p>Safari 2.0 was released on 29 April 2005, as the only web browser included with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X v10.4', 'OSX'); ?>.</p>
        <p>This version was touted by Apple as possessing a 1.8x speed boost over version 1.2.4, but did not yet include the Acid2 bug fixes.</p>
        <p>The necessary changes were not initially available to end-users unless they downloaded and compiled the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> source code themselves or ran one of the nightly automated builds available at <code>OpenDarwin.org</code>.</p>
        <p>Apple eventually released version 2.0.2 of Safari, which included the modifications required to pass Acid2, on 31 October 2005.</p>
        <p>In June 2005, after some criticism from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KHTML', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> developers over lack of access to change logs, Apple moved the development source code and bug tracking of WebCore and JavaScriptCore to OpenDarwin.org. WebKit itself was also released as open source. The source code for non-renderer aspects of the browser, such as its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?> elements, remains proprietary.</p>
        <p>The final stable version of Safari 2, Safari 2.0.4, was released on 10 January 2006 for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?>. It was only available as part of Mac OS X Update 10.4.4.</p>
        <p>This version addresses layout and CPU usage issues, among others. Safari 2.0.4 was the last version to be released exclusively on Mac OS X until version 6 in 2012.</p>
