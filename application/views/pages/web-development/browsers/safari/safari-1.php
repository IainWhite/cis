        <p>On 7 January 2003, at Macworld San Francisco, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Jobs', 'P'); ?> announced that <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> had developed their own <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?>, called <strong>Safari</strong>.</p>
        <p>It was based on Apple's internal fork of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KHTML', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> rendering engine, called <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'webdevelopment/layout-engines'); ?>. Apple released the first beta version for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> that day.</p>
        <p>A number of official and unofficial beta versions followed, until version 1.0 was released on 23 June 2003.</p>
        <p>Initially only available as a separate download for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X v10.2', 'OSX'); ?>, it was included with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X v10.3', 'XOS'); ?> release on 24 October 2003 as the default browser, with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer for Mac', 'IE'); ?> included only as an alternative browser.</p>
