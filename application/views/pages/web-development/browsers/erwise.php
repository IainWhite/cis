        <p><strong>Erwise</strong> was a pioneering <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?>, and the first commonly available with a graphical user interface.</p>
        <p>Released in April 1992, the browser was written for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> computers running X and used the W3 common access library.</p>
        <p>Erwise was the combined master's project of four Finnish students at the Helsinki University of Technology: Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd√§nmaanlakka.</p>
        <p>The group decided to create a web browser at the suggestion of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Robert Calliau', 'P'); ?>, who was visiting the university and were supervised by Ari Lemmke.</p>
        <p>The development of Erwise halted after the students graduated and went on to other projects. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Tim Berners-Lee', 'P'); ?>, the creator of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?>, travelled to Finland to encourage the group to continue with the project. However, none of the project members could afford to continue with the project without proper funding.</p>
