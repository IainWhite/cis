        <p><strong>AOL Explorer</strong>, previously known as <strong>AOL Browser</strong>, is a graphical web <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Trident', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('layout engine', 'WD'); ?> and was released by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AOL', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>In July 2005, AOL launched AOL Explorer as a free download and as an optional download with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AIM', 'WD'); ?> version 5.9.</p>
        <p>On November 2005, the next version, 1.1, was released. Version 1.2 was very similar to version 1.1, but included two new features: Tab Explorer and RSS Widgets from Favourites.</p>
        <p>When the Tab Explorer button is pressed, a thumbnail preview of each tab is displayed in a full-screen window.</p>
        <p>The user can click on one of the previews to instantly access the page.</p>
        <p>Microsoft has implemented a similar feature in their <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 7', 'IE'); ?> browser, called "Quick Tabs".</p>
        <p>Version 1.5 was launched in May 2006, and included many new features such as Desktop Widgets, Visual Themes, a Feeds Screensaver and various performance improvements.</p>
        <p>Desktop Widgets allow the user to "tear off" a side panel and use it independently from the browser.</p>
        <p>The panel will remain open and functional, even after one closes AOL Explorer.</p>
        <p>When ones computer is idle, one can set the AOL Explorer Feeds Screensaver to display the RSS feeds stored in the feeds panel.</p>
        <p>Another feature new to 1.5 is the Show Page Preview feature, which allows the user to preview a webpage without leaving the current page by simply holding down <code>Ctrl</code> and right-clicking on a link.</p>
        <p>This feature is especially useful when there are a large amount of links on a page, or when searching.</p>
        <p>In 2003, AOL signed a seven-year contract with Microsoft to use the Trident layout engine in their products and as such AOL Explorer uses this engine.</p>
        <p>Because of this, users can use AOL Explorer to download and install updates from Microsoft Update.</p>
        <p>However, unlike <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?>, AOL does not use <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bling', 'WD'); ?> as the default search engine.</p>
        <p>AOL is also the owner of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Netscape Communications Corporation', 'C'); ?> which had previously published the now defunct <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Netscape', 'WB'); ?> series of browsers.</p>
