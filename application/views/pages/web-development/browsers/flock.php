        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Flock Web Browser'); ?>
        <p><strong>Flock</strong> was a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browser', 'WD'); ?> that specialized in providing social networking and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web 2.0', 'WD'); ?> facilities built into its user interface.</p>
        <p>Earlier versions of Flock used the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Gecko', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> HTML rendering engine by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Version 2.6.2, released in July 2010, was the last version based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Firefox', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Starting with version 3, Flock was based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chromium', 'WB'); ?> and so used the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> rendering engine.</p>
        <p>Flock was available as a free download, and supported <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?> and, at one time, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> as well.</p>
        <p>Support for Flock was discontinued in April 2011.</p>
