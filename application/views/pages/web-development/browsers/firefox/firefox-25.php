        <p><strong>Firefox 25</strong> was released on 29 October 2013.</p>
        <p>Firefox 25 Nightly was at one point slated to include the Australis theme, but Australis did not actually land on Nightly until Firefox 28.</p>
        <p>This release added support for <code>iframe srcdoc</code> attribute, <code>background-attachment:local</code> in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?>, along with Web audio API support, separate find bar for each tab and many other bug fixes.</p>
        <p>Firefox 25.0.1 was released on 15 November 2013, to address issues with pages that sometimes wouldn't load without first moving the cursor.</p>
