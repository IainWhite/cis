        <p><strong>Firefox 1.5</strong> was released on 30 November 2005.</p>
        <p>While Firefox 1.5 was originally slated to arrive later, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Foundation', 'C'); ?>  abandoned the 1.1 release plan after the first two 1.1 alpha builds, merging it with the feature set of 1.5, which ended up being released later than the original 1.1 date.</p>
        <p>The new version resynchronized the code base of the release builds (as opposed to nightly builds) with the core "trunk", which contained additional features not available in 1.0, as it branched from the trunk around the 0.9 release.</p>
        <p>As such, there was a backlog of bug fixes between 0.9 and the release of 1.0, which were made available in 1.5.</p>
        <p>Version 1.5 implemented a new Mac-like options interface, the subject of much criticism from Windows and Linux users, with a "Sanitize" action to allow someone to clear their privacy related information without manually clicking the "Clear All" button.</p>
        <p>In Firefox 1.5, a user could clear all privacy related settings simply by exiting the browser or using a keyboard shortcut, depending on their settings.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the software update system was improved (with binary patches now possible).</p>
        <p>There were also improvements in the extension management system, with a number of new developer features.</p>
        <p>In addition, Firefox 1.5 had preliminary <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SVG', 'WD'); ?>  1.1 support.</p>
        <p>Alpha builds of Firefox 1.5 (1.1a1 and 1.1a2) did not carry Firefox branding; they were labeled "<em>Deer Park</em>" (which was Firefox 1.5's internal codename) and contained a different program icon.</p>
        <p>This was done to dissuade end-users from downloading preview versions, which are intended for developers only.</p>
        <p>Firefox 1.5.0.12 was the final version supported on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIn'); ?> .</p>
