        <p><strong>Firefox 31</strong> and Firefox 31 ESR were released on 22 July 2014. Both versions added search field on the new tab page and were improved to block malware from downloaded files, along with other new features. Firefox 31 ESR is the first ESR to include the Australis interface, unifying the user experience across different Firefox versions. Firefox 24.x.x ESR versions will be automatically updated to ESR version 31 after 14 October 2014.</p>
