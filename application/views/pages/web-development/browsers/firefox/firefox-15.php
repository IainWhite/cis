        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Firefox Version 15'); ?>
        <p><strong>Firefox 15</strong> was released on 28 August 2012.</p>
        <p>Firefox version includes a "Responsive Design View" developer tool, adds support for the Opus audio format and adds preliminary native <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PDF', 'IT'); ?> support (turned off by default).</p>
        <p>Silent updates automatically update <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox', 'WB'); ?> to the latest version without notifying the user, a feature that the web browsers <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google Chrome', 'WB'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 8', 'IE'); ?> and above have already implemented, although the user is able to disable that function.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla', 'C'); ?> improved regular start-up time for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> users.</p>
