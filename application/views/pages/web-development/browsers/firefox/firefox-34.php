        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Firefox Version 34'); ?>
        <p><strong>Firefox 34.0</strong> was released on 1 December 2014. It brings <strong>Firefox Hello</strong> (a WebRTC client for voice and video chat), an improved search bar, and the implementation of HTTP/2 (draft14) and ALPN, together with other features. It also disables <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SSL', 'IPA'); ?> v3, and enables the ability to recover from a locked Firefox process and to switch themes and personas directly in the customisation mode.</p>
        <p>Firefox 34.0.5 was released for desktop only on 1 December 2014, changing the default search engine to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Yahoo!', 'C'); ?> for North America.</p>
