        <p><strong>Firefox version 3.5</strong>, codenamed <strong>Shiretoko</strong>, adds a variety of new features to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Initially numbered Firefox 3.1, Mozilla developers decided to change the numbering of the release to 3.5, in order to reflect a significantly greater scope of changes than originally planned.</p>
        <p>The final release was on 30 June 2009.</p>
        <p>The changes included much faster performance thanks to an upgrade to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SpiderMonkey', 'web-development/javascript-engine'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> called <strong>TraceMonkey</strong> and rendering improvements, and support for the <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code> tags as defined in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML5', 'WD'); ?> specification, with a goal to offer video playback without being encumbered by patent problems associated with many video technologies.</p>
        <p>Cross-site <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XMLHttpRequests', 'WD'); ?> (XHR), which can allow for more powerful web applications and an easier way to implement mashups, are also implemented in 3.5.</p>
        <p>A new global <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JSON', 'WD'); ?> object contains native functions to efficiently and safely serialize and deserialize JSON objects, as specified by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ECMAScript', 'JS'); ?> 3.1 draft.</p>
        <p>Full <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS-3', 'WD'); ?> selector support has been added.</p>
        <p>Firefox 3.5 uses the Gecko 1.9.1 engine, which includes a few features that were not included in the 3.0 release.</p>
        <p>Multi-touch trackpad support was also added to the release, including gesture support like pinching for zooming and swiping for back and forward.</p>
        <p>Firefox 3.5 also features an updated logo.</p>
