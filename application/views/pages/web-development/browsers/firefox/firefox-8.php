        <p><strong>Firefox 8</strong> verified that users really wanted any previously installed add-ons.</p>
        <p>Upon installation, a dialog box prompted users to enable or disable the add-ons.</p>
        <p>Add-ons installed by third-party programs were disabled by default, but user-installed add-ons were enabled by default.</p>
        <p>Mozilla judged that third-party installed add-ons were problematic, taking away user control, lagging behind on compatibility and security updates, slowing down <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox', 'WB'); ?> start-up and page loading time, and cluttering the interface with unused toolbars.</p>
