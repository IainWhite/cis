        <p><strong>Firefox 10</strong> was released on 31 January 2012.</p>
        <p>It is the first official extended support release.</p>
        <p>Firefox 10 hides the forward arrow button until there is a website to go forward to, or it is manually activated.</p>
        <p>Firefox 10 adds a Full Screen API and improved <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebGL', 'WD'); ?> performance.</p>
        <p>Firefox 10 assumed all add-ons were compatible with version 10, as long as they are written for at least <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox 4', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The add-on developer is able to alert <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla', 'C'); ?> that the add-on is incompatible, overriding compatibility with version 10 or later.</p>
        <p>This new rule also does not apply to themes.</p>
        <p>Firefox 10 added the CSS Style Inspector to the Page Inspector, which allow users to check out a site's structure and edit the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?> without leaving the browser.</p>
        <p>Firefox 10 added support for CSS 3D Transforms and for anti-aliasing in the WebGL standard for hardware accelerated 3D graphics.</p>
        <p>These updates mean that complex site and Web app animations will render more smoothly in Firefox, and that developers can animate 2D objects into 3D without plug-ins.</p>
