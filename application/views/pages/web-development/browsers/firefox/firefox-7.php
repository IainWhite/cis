        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Firefox Version 7'); ?>
        <p><strong>Firefox 7</strong>, released 27 September 2011, uses as much as 50% less memory than <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox 4', 'WB'); ?> as a result of the MemShrink project to reduce Firefox memory usage.</p>
        <p>Mozilla Firefox 7.0.1 was released a few days later, fixing a rare, but serious, issue with add-ons not being detected by the browser.</p>
