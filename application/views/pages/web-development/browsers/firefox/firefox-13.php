        <p><strong>Firefox 13</strong> was released on 5 June 2012.</p>
        <p>Firefox 13 adds and updates several features, such as an updated new tab and home tab page.</p>
        <p>The updated new tab page is a feature similar to the Speed Dial already present in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Opera', 'WB'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google Chrome', 'WB'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Safari', 'WB'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?>. The new tab page will display nine of the user's most visited websites, along with a cached image.</p>
        <p>In addition to the updated new tab and home tab page, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla', 'C'); ?> has added a user profile cleaner / reset, reduced hang times, and implemented tabs on demand.</p>
        <p>The user profile cleaner/reset provides a way for users to fix Firefox errors and glitches that may occur.</p>
        <p>Mozilla's tabs on demand restores tabs that were open in the previous session, but will keep the tabs unloaded until the user requests to view the page.</p>
        <p>Starting with this version, Windows support was exclusively for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows XP', 'WIN'); ?> SP2 / SP3, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Vista', 'WIN'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 7', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
