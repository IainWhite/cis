        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Firefox Version 2'); ?>
        <p>On 24 October 2006, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla', 'C'); ?> released <strong>Firefox 2</strong>.</p>
        <p>This version includes updates to the tabbed browsing environment; the extensions manager; the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?> (Graphical User Interface); and the find, search and software update engines; a new session restore feature; inline spell checking; and an anti-phishing feature which was implemented by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> as an extension, and later merged into the program itself.</p>
        <p>In December 2007, Firefox Live Chat was launched. It allows users to ask volunteers questions through a system powered by Jive Software, with guaranteed hours of operation and the possibility of help after hours.</p>
        <p>Firefox 2.0.0.20 is the final version which can run under an unmodified installation of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Widows NT 4.0', 'WIN'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 98', 'WIN'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Me', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Mozilla Corporation announced it would not develop new versions of Firefox 2 after the 2.0.0.20 release, but continued Firefox 2 development as long as other programs, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Thunderbird', 'ITS'); ?> mail client, depended on it.</p>
        <p>The final internal release was 2.0.0.22, released in late April 2009.</p>
