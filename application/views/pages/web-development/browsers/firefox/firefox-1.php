        <p><strong>Firefox 1.0</strong> was released on 9 November 2004.</p>
        <p>The launch of version 1.0 was accompanied by "<em>a respectable amount of pre-launch fervor</em>" including a fan organized campaign to run a full-page ad in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Although the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Foundation', 'C'); ?> had intended to make the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Suite', 'WB'); ?> obsolete and replace it with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox', 'WB'); ?>, the Foundation continued to maintain the suite until 12 April 2006 because it had many corporate users and was bundled with other software.</p>
        <p>The Mozilla community (as opposed to the Foundation) continues to release new versions of the suite, using the product name <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SeaMonkey', 'WB'); ?> to avoid confusion with the original Mozilla Suite.</p>
