        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Firefox Version 16'); ?>
        <p><strong>Firefox 16</strong> was released on 9 October 2012.</p>
        <p>Plans for this version called for fixing of bugs still outstanding involving support of new features in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X Lion', 'OSX'); ?>, improvements to start-up speed when a user wants to restore a previous session, and support for viewing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PDF', 'IT'); ?> files in-line without a plugin.</p>
        <p>Opus audio format is now enabled by default. Support for web apps was added.</p>
        <p>The roll-out of Firefox 16.0.0 was stopped on 10 October 2012, after Mozilla detected a security flaw and recommended downgrading to 15.0.1 until the issue could be fixed.</p>
        <p>The security flaw was fixed in version 16.0.1, which was released the following day, 11 October 2012.</p>
        <p>Version 16.0.2 was released 26 October 2012. It fixed additional security issues, and is also the final release to support <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X Leopard', 'OSX'); ?>.</p>
