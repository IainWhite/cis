        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Firefox Version 26'); ?>
        <p><strong>Firefox 26</strong> was released 10 December 2013.<p>
        <p>Firefox 26 changed the behaviour of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> plugins to "click-to-play" mode instead of automatically running them.</p>
        <p>It also added support for H.264 on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>, password manager support for script generated fields, and the ability for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> users without advanced write permissions to update Firefox, as well as many bug fixes and developer related changes.</p>
        <p>Firefox 26.0.1 was released only for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Andriod', 'OS'); ?> on 20 December just ten days after the desktop release.</p>
        <p>It fixed screen distortion on some devices after tapping on search suggestion.</p>
