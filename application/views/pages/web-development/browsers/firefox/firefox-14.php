        <p><strong>Firefox 14.0</strong> for {<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> was released on 26 June 2012, just outside the regular release schedule of the web browser.</p>
        <p>In order to sync the version numbers of the desktop and mobile version of Firefox, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla', 'C'); ?> decided to release Firefox 14.0.1 for mobile and desktop on 17 July 2012, instead of Firefox 14.0 for the desktop and Firefox 14.0.1 for mobile clients.</p>
        <p>A new hang detector (similar to how Mozilla currently collects other data) allows Mozilla to collect, analyse, and identify the cause of the browser freezing / hanging.</p>
        <p>Mozilla will use this information to improve the responsiveness of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox', 'WB'); ?> for future releases.</p>
        <p>In addition to tackling freezing and not-responding errors that occur because of Firefox, Mozilla implemented opt-in activation for plugins such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Flash', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Mozilla wants to reduce potential problems that could arise through the unwanted use of third-party applications (malware, freezing, etc.).</p>
        <p>URL complete will suggest the website that Firefox believes the user plans on visiting. It does this by inserting the remaining characters into the URL form box.</p>
        <p>Firefox 14 has an optional GStreamer back-end for HTML5 video tag playback. This allows playback of H.264 if the codec is installed as a GStreamer plugin. GStreamer support is not enabled in the official builds, but can be enabled at compile time.</p>
        <p>The first beta version of Firefox 14 was not beta 1, but beta 6 and was released on 5 June 2012.</p>
