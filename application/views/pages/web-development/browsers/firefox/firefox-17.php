        <p><strong>Firefox 17</strong> and Firefox 17 ESR were released on 20 November 2012.</p>

        <p>Firefox 17 was not planned to bring as many user facing features as previous releases; it brings improved display of location bar results, improvements to the silent update mechanism for users with incompatible add-ons, and refinements to the Click-To-Play system introduced in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox 14', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>A new feature for developers, an HTML tree editor is also included.</p>
        <p>Starting with this version, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?> support is exclusively for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Snow Leopard', 'OSX'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lion', 'OSX'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mountain Lion', 'OSX'); ?>.</p>
