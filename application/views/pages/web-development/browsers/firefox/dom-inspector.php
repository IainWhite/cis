        <p><strong>DOM Inspector</strong> (<strong>DOMi</strong>) is a web developer tool created by <strong>Joe Hewitt</strong> and was originally included in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Application Suite', 'WB'); ?> as well as versions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Firefox', 'WB'); ?> prior to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox 3', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It is now included by default in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SeaMonkey', 'WB'); ?> and is an installable extension for subsequent versions of Firefox and other Mozilla based applications.</p>
        <p>Its main purpose is to inspect and edit the <strong>Document Object Model</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?>) tree of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> based documents.</p>
        <p>A DOM node can be selected from the tree structure, or by clicking on the browser chrome.</p>
        <p>As well as the DOM tree viewer, other viewers are also available, including Box Model, XBL Bindings, CSS Rules, Style Sheets, Computed Style, JavaScript Object, as well as a number of viewers for document and application accessibility.</p>
        <p>By default, the DOM Inspector highlights a newly selected non-attribute node with a red flashing border.</p>
        <p>Similar tools exist in other browsers, e.g., Opera's Dragonfly, Safari's Web Inspector, the Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar, and Google Chrome's Developer Tools.</p>
