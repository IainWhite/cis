        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Firefox Version 4'); ?>
        <p><strong>Firefox 3.7</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Gecko', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> 1.9.3) Alpha 1 was released on 10 February 2010.</p>
        <p>Alpha 2 was released on 1 March 2010, Alpha 3 on 17 March, Alpha 4 on 12 April, and Alpha 5 on 16 June.</p>
        <p>The version number was changed to 4.0 (and Gecko's was changed to 2.0) starting with Beta 1, released on 6 July 2010.</p>
        <p>Beta 2 was released on 27 July Beta 3 on 11 August, Beta 4 on 24 August, Beta 5 on 7 September, Beta 6 on 14 September.</p>
        <p>After major delays, Beta 7 was finally released on 10 November. Beta 7 was followed by Beta 8, released on 21 December. Beta 9 was released on 14 January 2011, Beta 10 on 25 January, Beta 11 on 8 February and Beta 12 on 12 February.</p>
        <p>Firefox then moved into the RC stage.</p>
        <p>The final version of Firefox 4 was released on 22 March 22, 2011.</p>
        <p>Version 4 brought a new user interface and is said to be faster.</p>
        <p>Early mock-ups of the new interface on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux were first made available in July 2009.</p>
        <p>Other new features included improved notifications, tab groups, application tabs, a redesigned add-on manager, integration with Firefox Sync, and support for multitouch displays.</p>
        <p>On 13 October 2006, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Brendan Eich', 'P'); ?>, Mozilla's Chief Technology Officer, wrote about the plans for "<em>Mozilla 2</em>", referring to the most comprehensive iteration (since its creation) of the overall platform on which Firefox and other Mozilla products run.</p>
        <p>Most of the objectives were gradually incorporated into Firefox through versions 3.0, 3.5, and 3.6. The largest changes, however, were planned for Firefox 4.</p>
        <p>Firefox 4 was based on the Gecko 2.0 engine, which added or improved support for HTML5, CSS3, WebM, and WebGL.</p>
        <p>It also included a new JavaScript engine (<strong>JagerMonkey</strong>) and better XPCOM APIs.</p>
