        <p><strong>Firefox version 3.6</strong>, released on 21 January 2010, uses the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Gecko', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> 1.9.2 engine and includes several interface improvements, such as "personas".</p>
        <p>This release was referred to as 3.2 before 3.1 was changed to 3.5.</p>
        <p>The codename for this version was "<em>Namoroka</em>".</p>
        <p>This is the last major, official version to run on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PowerPC', 'CPU'); ?> based <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintoshes', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
        <p>One minor update to Firefox 3.6, version 3.6.4 (code-named "<em>Lorentz</em>") is the first minor update to make non-intrusive changes other than minor stability and security fixes.</p>
        <p>It adds Out of Process Plugins (OOPP), which runs plugins in a separate process, allowing Firefox to recover from plugin crashes.</p>
        <p>Firefox 3.6.6 lengthens the amount of time a plug-in is allowed to be unresponsive before the plug-in quits.</p>
        <p>Support for Firefox 3.6 ended on 24 April 2012.</p>
