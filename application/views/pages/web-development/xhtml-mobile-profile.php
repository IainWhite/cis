        <p><strong>XHTML Mobile Profile (XHTML MP)</strong> is a hypertextual computer language standard designed specifically for mobile phones and other resource constrained devices.</p>
        <p>It is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XHTML', 'WD'); ?> document type defined by the <strong>Open Mobile Alliance</strong>. XHTML-MP is derived from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XHTML Basic', 'WD'); ?> 1.0 by adding XHTML Modules, with later versions of the standard adding more modules. However, for certain modules, XHTML-MP does not mandate a complete implementation so an XHTML-MP browser may not be fully conforming on all modules.</p>
        <p>XHTML Basic 1.1 became a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3C', 'C'); ?> Recommendation in July 2008, superseding XHTML-MP 1.2.</p>
