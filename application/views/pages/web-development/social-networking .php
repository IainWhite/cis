        <p>A <strong>social networking service</strong> is a platform to build social networks or social relations among people who, share interests, activities, backgrounds or real life connections.</p>
        <p>A social network service consists of a representation of each user (often a profile), his social links, and a variety of additional services.</p>
        <p>Social networking is web-based services that allow individuals to create a public profile, to create a list of users with whom to share connection, and view and cross the connections within the system.</p>
        <p>Social network sites are varied and they incorporate new information and communication tools such as, mobile connectivity, photo / video sharing and blogging.</p>
        <p>Online community services are sometimes considered as a social network service, though in a broader sense, social network service usually means an individual centered service whereas online community services are group centered.</p>
        <p>Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, pictures, posts, activities, events, interests with people in their network.</p>
        <p>The main types of social networking services are those that contain category places (such as former school year or classmates), means to connect with friends, and a recommendation system linked to trust.</p>
        <p>Popular methods now combine many of these, with services such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Facebook', 'URL'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google+', 'URL'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('YouTube', 'URL'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('LinkedIn', 'URL'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Instagram', 'URL'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pinterest', 'URL'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Tumblr', 'URL'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Twitter', 'URL'); ?>.</p>
