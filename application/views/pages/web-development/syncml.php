        <p><strong>SyncML (Synchronisation Markup Language)</strong> is the former name for a platform independent information synchronisation standard. The project is currently referred to as <strong>Open Mobile Alliance Data Synchronisation and Device Management</strong>. The purpose of SyncML is to offer an open standard as a replacement for existing data synchronisation solutions, which have mostly been somewhat vendor, application or operating system specific.</p>
