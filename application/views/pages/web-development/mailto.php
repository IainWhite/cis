        <p>The <strong>mailto</strong> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('URI', 'WD'); ?> scheme, as registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IANA', 'C'); ?>), defines the scheme for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SMTP', 'IPA'); ?>) email addresses. It allows users clicking a link in a website to send an e-mail without first having to copy the destination e-mail address and open an e-mail client. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's email client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the "To:" field.</p>
