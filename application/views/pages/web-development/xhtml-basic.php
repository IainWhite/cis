        <p><strong>XHTML Basic</strong> is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> based structured markup language primarily used for simple (mainly handheld) user agents, typically mobile devices.</p>
        <p>XHTML Basic is a subset of <strong>XHTML 1.1</strong>, defined using <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XHTML', 'WD'); ?> Modularisation including a reduced set of modules for document structure, images, forms, basic tables, and object support. XHTML Basic is suitable for mobile phones, PDAs, pagers, and set-top boxes.</p>
        <p>It will replace <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WML', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C-HTML', 'WD'); ?> as more compliant user agents are developed.</p>
        <p>One large advantage XHTML Basic has over WML and C-HTML is that XHTML Basic pages can be rendered differently in web browsers and on handhelds, without the need for two different versions of the same page.</p>
        <p></p>In 2006, the specification was revised to version 1.1. Six new features have been incorporated into the language in order to better serve the small device community.</p>
