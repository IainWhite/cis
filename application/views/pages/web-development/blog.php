        <p>A <strong>blog</strong> (a truncation of the expression <strong>web log</strong>) is a discussion or informational site published on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?> and consisting of discrete entries known as "<em>posts</em>" typically displayed in reverse chronological order (the most recent post appears first).</p>
        <p>Until 2009 blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject. More recently "multi-author blogs" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and professionally edited.</p>
        <p>MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic.</p>
        <p>The rise of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Twitter', 'URL'); ?> and other <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('microblogging', 'WD'); ?> systems helps integrate MABs and single author blogs into societal newstreams.</p>
        <p>Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.</p>
        <p>The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users.
        <p>Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FTP', 'IPA'); ?> had been required to publish content on the Web.</p>
        <p>Most blogs are interactive, allowing visitors to leave comments and even message each other via widgets on the blogs, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.</p>
        <p>In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('social networking', 'WD'); ?> service. Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs, but also build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.</p>
