        <p><strong>CSS Flex Box Layout</strong> is the latest layout model coming to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS-3', 'WD'); ?>. It is in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3C', 'C'); ?>'s Candidate Recommendation (CR) stage. The new flex layout allows elements within a container to be arranged in a way fitting to the screen or device that it is being viewed on. Unlike the block layout mode, the flex layout lacks the functionality of columns and floats. It does, however, allow more flexibility in the layout of the content within the container.</p>
        <p>One of the most defining features of the flex layout is its ability to form-fit, based on its viewing environment. Flex boxes can adjust in sizeâ€”either decreasing, to avoid unnecessarily monopolising space, or increasing to make room for contents to be constrained within its boundaries. Moreover, the flex layout is less restrictive in terms of content flow than those, for example, of the block and inline display types, which are generally uni-directional. Indeed, not only can flex directional flow be specified, at the style level, as rightwards, leftwards, upwards, or downwards; individual items within a flex container may also be automatically reordered and rearranged to suit the available layout space.</p>
