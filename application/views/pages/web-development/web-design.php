        <p><strong>Web Design</strong> encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.</p>
        <p>The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UI', 'IT'); ?>); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UX', 'IT'); ?>); and search engine optimization (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SEO', 'WD'); ?>).</p>
        <p>Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.</p>
        <p>The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('front-end', 'WD'); ?> (client side) design of a website including writing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('mark-up', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web Development', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web accessibility', 'WD'); ?> guidelines.</p>
