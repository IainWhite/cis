        <p>The <strong>Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML)</strong> is a markup language intended for display on handheld computers, information appliances, smartphones, etc.. It is similar to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?>, but for wireless and handheld devices with small displays, like PDA, mobile phones and so on.</p>
        <p>It was originally developed in about 1996 by <strong>Unwired Planet</strong>, the company that became <strong>Phone.com</strong> and then <strong>Openwave</strong>. HDML was submitted to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('W3C', 'C'); ?> for standardisation, but was not turned into a standard. Instead it became an important influence on the development and standardisation of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WML', 'WD'); ?>, which then replaced HDML in practice. (Although HDML is still in use in Japan by KDDI brands such as au, especially for mobile banking solutions).</p>
