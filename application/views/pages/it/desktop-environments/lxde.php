        <p><strrong>LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment)</strong> is a free desktop environment with comparatively low resource requirements. This makes it especially suitable for resource constrained personal computers such as netbooks or System on a chip computers.</p>
        <p>LXDE is a desktop environment designed for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix-like', 'OS'); ?> platforms, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FreeBSD', 'OS'); ?>. The goal of the project is to provide a desktop environment that is fast and energy efficient.</p>
        <p>In 2010, tests suggested that LXDE 0.5 had the lowest memory usage of the four most popular desktop environments of the time (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNOME', 'IT'); ?> 2.29, KDE Plasma Desktop 4.4, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Xfce', 'IT'); ?> 4.6), and that it consumed less energy, which suggests mobile computers with Linux distributions running LXDE 0.5 drained their battery at a slower pace than those with other desktop environments.</p>
        <p>LXDE is the default desktop environment of Knoppix, Lubuntu, LXLE Linux, Peppermint Linux OS and Raspbian, among other distributions.</p>
