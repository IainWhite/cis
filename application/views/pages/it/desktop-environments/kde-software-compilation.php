        <p>The <strong>KDE Software Compilation (KDE SC)</strong> is a desktop environment and an associated range of KDE Applications produced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KDE', 'C'); ?>. Prior to version 4.4, released in February 2010, the Software Compilation was known as KDE, which stood for <strong>K Desktop Environment</strong> until November 2009. The KDE SC includes only applications whose development teams choose to follow the Software Compilation's release schedule; as a result, many popular KDE applications, such as Amarok and Digikam, are not part of the Software Compilation. To date there have been five series of releases.</p>
        <p>KDE was founded in 1996 by <strong>Matthias Ettrich</strong>, who was then a student at the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen. At the time, he was troubled by certain aspects of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> desktop. Among his qualms was that none of the applications looked, felt, or worked alike. He proposed the formation of not only a set of applications, but, rather, a desktop environment, in which users could expect things to look, feel, and work consistently. He also wanted to make this desktop easy to use; one of his complaints with desktop applications of the time was that his girlfriend could not use them. His initial Usenet post spurred a lot of interest, and the KDE project was born.</p>
        <p>Ettrich chose to use Trolltech’s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Qt', 'IT'); ?> framework for the KDE project. Other programmers quickly started developing KDE/Qt applications, and by early 1997, a few applications were being released.</p>
