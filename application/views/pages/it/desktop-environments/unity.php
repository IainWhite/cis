        <p><strong>Unity</strong> is a graphical shell for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNOME desktop enviroment', 'IT'); ?> developed by <strong>Canonical Ltd</strong> for its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ubuntu', 'OS'); ?> operating system. Unity debuted in the netbook edition of Ubuntu 10.10. It was initially designed to make more efficient use of space given the limited screen size of netbooks, including, for example, a vertical application switcher called the launcher, and a space saving horizontal multipurpose top menu bar.</p>
        <p></p>Unlike <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNOME', 'IT'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KDE Software Compilation', 'IT'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Xfce', 'IT'); ?>, or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('LXDE', 'IT'); ?>, Unity is not a collection of applications but is designed to use existing programs.</p>
