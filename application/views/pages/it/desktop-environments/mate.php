        <p><strong>MATE</strong> is a desktop environment forked from the now unmaintained code base of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNOME 2', 'IT'); ?>. It is named after the South American plant <em>Yerba mate</em> and tea made from the herb, mate. The use of a new name, instead of GNOME, avoids conflicts with GNOME 3 components.</p>
        <p></p>GNOME 3 (released in April 2011) replaced the classic desktop metaphor, substituting its native user interface: GNOME Shell. This action led to some criticism from the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> community. Some users refused to accept the new interface design of GNOME and called for continued development of GNOME 2. An Argentinian user of <strong>Arch Linux</strong> started the MATE project in order to meet this demand and announced the availability of Mate on 18 June 2011.</p>
