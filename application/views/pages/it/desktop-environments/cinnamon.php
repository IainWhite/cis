        <p><strong>Cinnamon</strong> is a desktop environment that is based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GTK+', 'IT'); ?> 3 toolkit. It was released in 2011. The project was originally started as a fork of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNOME Shell', 'IT'); ?>, i.e. a mere graphical shell, but became its own desktop environment in Cinnamon 2.0. Cinnamon was initially developed by (and for) the Linux distribution [Linux Mint]<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux Mint', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Because the Cinnamon desktop environment intends to implement a different graphical user interface (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?>) than the GNOME desktop environment, many of the GNOME Core Applications were forked, so that their GUIs can be rewritten appropriately.</p>
