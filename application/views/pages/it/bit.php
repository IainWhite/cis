        <p>A <strong>bit</strong> is the basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a 0 or 1. The term bit is a portmanteau of binary digit.</p>
        <p>The two values can also be interpreted as logical values (true / false, yes / no), algebraic signs (+ / âˆ’), activation states (on / off), or any other two-valued attribute. The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program. The length of a binary number may be referred to as its bit-length.</p>
        <p>In information theory, one bit is typically defined as the uncertainty of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known.</p>
        <p>In quantum computing, a quantum bit or qubit is a quantum system that can exist in superposition of two classical (i.e., non-quantum) bit values.</p>
        <p>The symbol for bit, as a unit of information, is either simply <code>bit</code> (recommended by the ISO/IEC standard 80000-13 (2008)) or lowercase <code>b</code> (recommended by the IEEE 1541 Standard (2002)). A group of eight bits is commonly called one <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('byte', 'IT'); ?>, but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined.</p>
