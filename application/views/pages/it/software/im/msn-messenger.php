        <p><strong>Windows Live Messenger</strong> (formerly <strong>MSN Messenger</strong>) is a discontinued <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('instant messaging', 'ITS'); ?> client developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>, Xbox 360, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Blackberry OS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java ME', 'LJ'); ?>, S60 on Symbian OS 9.x, and Zune HD. It connected to the Microsoft Messenger service while also having compatibility with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Yahoo! Messenger', 'IM'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Facebook Messenger', 'IM'); ?>. The client was first released as MSN Messenger on 22 July 1999, and was marketed under the MSN branding until 2005 when it was rebranded under Windows Live and has since been officially known by its present name, although its previous name was still used colloquially by most of its users. In June 2009, Microsoft reported the service attracted over 330 million active users each month, placing Messenger among the most widely used instant messaging clients in the world.</p>
        <p>Following the acquisition of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Skype Technologies', 'C'); ?> in May 2011, Microsoft added interoperability between Skype and Microsoft accounts, allowing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Skype', 'ITS'); ?> (which had features unique to its platform and a wider user base) to communicate with Messenger contacts. In 2013, Windows Live Messenger was discontinued and Microsoft began ceasing service to existing clients. Exceptionally, the service in China remained active 18 months longer, being announced to cease operations on 31 October 2014.</p>
