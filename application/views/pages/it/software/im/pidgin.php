        <p><strong>Pidgin</strong> (formerly named <strong>Gaim</strong>) is a free and open-source multi-platform <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('instant messaging', 'ITS'); ?> client, based on a library named <code>libpurple</code>. <code>Libpurple</code> has support for many instant messaging protocols, allowing the user to simultaneously log into various services from one application.</p>
        <p>The number of Pidgin users was estimated to be over three million in 2007.</p>
        <p>Pidgin is widely used for its <strong>Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR)</strong> plugin, which offers end-to-end encryption. <strong>Chelsea Manning</strong> used it when leaking documents that would later be hosted by <strong>Wikileaks</strong>. It is also included in the privacy and anonymity focused operating system <strong>Tails</strong> for this reason.</p>
