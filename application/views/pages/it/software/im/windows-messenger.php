        <p><strong>Windows Messenger</strong> is a discontinued <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('instant messaging', 'ITS'); ?> client included in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows XP', 'WIN'); ?>. Designed for use by both corporate and home users, it was originally created as a streamlined and integrated version of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MSN Messenger', 'IM'); ?>. It was later upgraded in 2004, when it was made available for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 2000', 'WIN'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Server 2003', 'WIS'); ?>. Since then, its development stopped. It was superseded by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Live Messenger', 'IM'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Lync', 'IM'); ?>.</p>
