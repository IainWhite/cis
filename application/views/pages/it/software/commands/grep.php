        <p><strong>Grep</strong> is a command line utility for searching plain text data sets for lines matching a regular expression. Grep was originally developed for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> operating system, but is available today for all <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix like', 'OS'); ?> systems. Its name comes from the ed command <code>g/re/p</code> (globally search a regular expression and print), which has the same effect: doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching lines.</p>
        <p>Grep was created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ken Thompson', 'P'); ?> as a standalone application adapted from the regular expression parser he had written for ed (which he also created). In ed, the command <code>g/re/p</code> would print all lines matching a previously defined pattern.</p>
