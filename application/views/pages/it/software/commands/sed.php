        <p><strong>Sed</strong> (<strong>stream editor</strong>) is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?>  utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. sed was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bell Labs', 'C'); ?> , and is available today for most operating systems.</p>
        <p>Sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor <strong>ed</strong> ("<em>editor</em>", 1971) and the earlier <strong>qed</strong> ("<em>quick editor</em>", 1965 - 66). sed was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command.</p>
