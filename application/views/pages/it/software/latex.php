        <p><strong>LaTeX</strong> is a document preparation system and document markup language.</p>
        <p>It is widely used for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science.</p>
        <p>It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Arabic, including critical editions.</p>
        <p>LaTeX uses the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TeX', 'ITS'); ?> typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.</p>
        <p>LaTeX is not the name of a particular editing program, but refers to the encoding or tagging conventions that are used in LaTeX documents.</p>
        <p>LaTeX is widely used in academia. Its syntax is also used as the primary method of displaying formulas on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wikipedia', 'URL'); ?>.</p>
        <p>LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system, or as an intermediate format.</p>
        <p>In the latter role, for example, it is often used as part of a pipeline for translating <strong>DocBook</strong> and other <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> based formats to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PDF', 'IT'); ?>. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies.</p>
        <p>Like TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but from early in its development it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that included complex non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese.</p>
        <p>LaTeX is intended to provide a high-level language that accesses the power of TeX. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX macros and a program to process LaTeX documents.</p>
        <p>Because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it offers authors ready made commands for common requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies.</p>
        <p>LaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by <strong>Leslie Lamport</strong> at <strong>SRI International</strong>.</p>
