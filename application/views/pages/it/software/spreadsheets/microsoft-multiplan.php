        <p><strong>Multiplan</strong> was an early spreadsheet program developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Known initially by the code name "<em>EP</em>" (for "<em>Electronic Paper</em>"), it was introduced in 1982 as a competitor for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VisiCalc', 'SS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Multiplan was released first for computers running <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?>; it was developed using a Microsoft proprietary p-code <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?> compiler as part of a portability strategy that facilitated ports to systems such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'OS'); ?>, Xenix, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore 64', 'ITH'); ?> and 128, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Texas Instruments', 'C'); ?> TI-99/4A, Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II, TRS-80 Model 4, TRS-80 Model 100 (on ROM), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple II', 'ITH'); ?>, and Burroughs B-20 series.</p>
        <p>Despite the release of <strong>Microsoft Chart</strong>, a graphics companion program, Multiplan continued to be outsold by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus 1-2-3', 'SS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It was replaced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Excel', 'SS'); ?> which followed some years later on both the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> (1985) and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> (1987).</p>
