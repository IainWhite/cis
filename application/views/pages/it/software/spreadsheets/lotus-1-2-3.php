        <p><strong>Lotus 1-2-3</strong> is a spreadsheet program from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus Software', 'C'); ?> (now part of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>).</p>
        <p>It was the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'PC'); ?>â€™s first "<em>killer application</em>"; its huge popularity in the mid 1980s contributed significantly to the success of the IBM PC in the corporate environment.</p>
        <p>The first spreadsheet, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visicalc', 'SS'); ?>, had helped launch the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple II', 'ITH'); ?> as one of the earliest personal computers in business use.</p>
        <p>With IBM's entry into the market, VisiCalc was slow to respond, and when they did, they launched what was essentially a straight port of their existing system in spite of the greatly expanded hardware capabilities. Lotus' solution was marketed as a three-in-one, integrated solution, which handled spreadsheet calculations, graphical charts, and database functionality - thus the name "1-2-3".</p>
        <p>1-2-3 quickly overtook VisiCalc, as well as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MultiPlan', 'SS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SuperCalc', 'SS'); ?>, two VisiCalc competitors.</p>
        <p>1-2-3 was the de-facto standard throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, part of a triumvirate of products that included <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('dBASE', 'DB'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WordPerfect', 'WP'); ?> to build a complete small business platform.</p>
        <p>It was not until the acceptance of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windowns 3', 'WIN'); ?> started to grow that the market began to change. None of these companies had seriously considered the graphical user interface in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> era, and responded slowly to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>'s own products, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Excel', 'SS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Word', 'SP'); ?>.</p>
        <p>As the early 1990s ended, 1-2-3 was in the number three position, and never recovered.</p>
        <p>IBM purchased Lotus and continued sales, only officially ending sales in 2013.</p>
