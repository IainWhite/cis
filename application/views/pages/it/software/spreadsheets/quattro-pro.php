        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Quattro Pro'); ?>
        <p><strong>Quattro Pro</strong> is a spreadsheet program developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland', 'C'); ?> and now sold by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Corel', 'C'); ?>, most often as part of <strong>Corel's WordPerfect Office suite</strong>.</p>
        <p>Historically, Quattro Pro used keyboard commands close to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus 1-2-3', 'SWS'); ?>. It is commonly said to have been the first program to use tabbed sheets. Actually, <strong>Boeing Calc</strong> had tabbed sheets earlier.</p>
        <p>For years Quattro Pro had a comparative advantage, in regards to maximum row and column limits, (allowing a maximum worksheet size of one million rows by 18,276 columns). This avoided the 65,536 row by 256 column spreadsheet limitations inherent to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Excel', 'SWS'); ?>, (prior to Excel 2007).</p>
        <p>Even with the maximum row advantage, Quattro Pro has been a distant second to Excel, in regards to the number of sales, since approximately 1996 to the present.</p>
        <p>When version 1.0 was in development, it was codenamed "<em>Buddha</em>" since it was meant to "<em>assume the Lotus position</em>", #1 in the market.</p>
        <p>When the product was launched in 1988, its original name was Quattro (the Italian word for "four", a play on being one step ahead of "1-2-3"). Borland changed the name to Quattro Pro for its 1990 release.</p>
