        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('SuperCalc'); ?>
        <p><strong>SuperCalc</strong> was a spreadsheet application published by <strong>Sorcim</strong> in 1980, and originally bundled (along with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WordStar', 'WP'); ?>) as part of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?> software package included with the <strong>Osborne 1</strong> portable computer.</p>
        <p>Versions of SuperCalc were later released for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple II', 'ITH'); ?> family, for PCs running <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>, and, after Sorcim was bought by <strong>CA Technologies</strong> (CA) in the mid 1980s, for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS Windows', 'OS'); ?> (under the name <strong>CA-SuperCalc</strong>).</p>
