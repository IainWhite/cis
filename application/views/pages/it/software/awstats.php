        <p><strong>AWStats</strong> is an open source Web analytics reporting tool, suitable for analysing data from Internet services such as web, streaming media, mail, and FTP servers. AWStats parses and analyses server log files, producing [HTML] reports. Data is visually presented within reports by tables and bar graphs. Static reports can be created through a command line interface, and on-demand reporting is supported through a Web browser <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CGI', 'WD'); ?> program.</p>
        <p>AWStats supports most major web server log file formats including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apache', 'WS'); ?> (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or Common Log Format (CLF)), WebStar, [IIS]<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IIS', 'WS'); ?> (W3C log format), and many other common web server log formats. Developers can contribute to the AWStats project through SourceForge.net.</p>
