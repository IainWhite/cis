        <p><strong>TeX</strong> is a typesetting system designed and mostly written by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Donald Knuth', 'P'); ?> and released in 1978.</p>
        <p>Together with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Metafont', 'IT'); ?> language for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('font', 'IT'); ?> description and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Computer Modern', 'IT'); ?> family of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('typefaces', 'IT'); ?>, TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using a reasonably minimal amount of effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, now and in the future.</p>
        <p>TeX is a popular means by which to typeset complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems in the world.</p>
        <p>TeX is popular in academia, especially in mathematics, computer science, economics, engineering, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology.</p>
