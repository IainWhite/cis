        <p><strong>WordPerfect</strong> is a word processing application owned by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Corel', 'C'); ?> with a long history on multiple personal computer platforms.</p>
        <p>The program was originally developed under contract at Brigham Young University for use on a Data General minicomputer in 1979.</p>
        <p>The authors retained the rights to the program, forming Satellite Systems International (SSI) to sell it under the name WordPerfect in 1980. A port to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> followed in 1982 and several greatly updated versions quickly followed.</p>
        <p>The application's feature list was considerably more advanced than contemporary DOS applications like <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WordStar', 'WP'); ?>, and it rapidly displaced most other systems, especially after the 4.2 release in 1986. By release 5.1 in 1989, WordPerfect had become a standard in the DOS market.</p>
        <p>At the height of its popularity in the 1980s it was a dominant player in the word processor market, but has long since been eclipsed in number of users by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Word', 'WP'); ?>. While best known in its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> versions, its early popularity was based partly on its availability for a wide variety of computers and operating systems.</p>
