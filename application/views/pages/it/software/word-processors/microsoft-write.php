        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Microsoft Write'); ?>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Write</strong> is a basic word processor included with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> and later, until <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT 3.5', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Throughout its lifespan it was minimally updated, and is comparable to early versions of <strong>MacWrite</strong>.</p>
        <p>Early versions of Write only work with Write (<code>.wri</code>) files, but after <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 3', 'WIN'); ?>, Write became capable of reading and composing early <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Word', 'WP'); ?> (<code>.doc</code>) documents.</p>
        <p>With Windows 3.1, Write became <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OLE', 'IT'); ?> capable. In <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?>, Write was replaced with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WordPad', 'WP'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Being a word processor, Write features additional document formatting features that are not found in <strong>Notepad</strong> (a simple text editor), such as a choice of font, text decorations and paragraph indentation for different parts of the document.</p>
        <p>Unlike WordPad, Write can justify a paragraph.</p>
