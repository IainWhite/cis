        <p><strong>WordStar</strong> is a word processor application that had a dominant market share during the early to mid 1980s.</p>
        <p>Formerly published by <strong>MicroPro International</strong> it was originally written for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?> operating system but later ported to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Although <strong>Seymour I. Rubinstein</strong> was the principal owner of the company, <strong>Rob Barnaby</strong> was the sole author of the early versions of the program.</p>
        <p>Starting with WordStar 4.0, the program was built on new code written principally by <strong>Peter Mierau</strong>.</p>
        <p>WordStar was deliberately written to make as few assumptions about the underlying system as possible, allowing it to be easily ported across the many platforms that proliferated in the early 1980s.</p>
        <p>As all of these versions had relatively similar commands and controls, users could move between platforms with equal ease.</p>
        <p>Already popular, its inclusion with the <strong>Osborne 1</strong> computer made the program become the de facto standard for much of the word processing market.</p>
