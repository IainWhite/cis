        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Microsoft WordPad'); ?>
        <p><strong>WordPad</strong> is a basic word processor that is included with almost all versions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?> onwards.</p>
        <p>It is more advanced than <strong>Notepad</strong> but simpler than <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Works', 'ITS'); ?> Word Processor and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Word', 'WP'); ?>. It replaced <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Write', 'WP'); ?>.</p>
        <p>WordPad was introduced in Windows 95, replacing Microsoft Write, which came with all previous versions of Windows (version 3.11 and earlier).</p>
        <p>The source code to WordPad was also distributed by Microsoft as a Microsoft Foundation Classes sample application with MFC 3.2 and later, shortly before the release of Windows 95.</p>
        <p>It is still available for download from the MSDN Web site.</p>
        <p>The default font used in Windows 95 to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Vista', 'WIN'); ?> was Arial 10, in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 7', 'WIN'); ?> it was changed to Calibri 11.</p>
        <p>A similar word processor called WordPad is supplied by some vendors on a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows CE', 'WIN'); ?> pre-installation.</p>
        <p>It has simple functionality like its desktop OS cousin. The icon resembles an early Microsoft Word icon.</p>
