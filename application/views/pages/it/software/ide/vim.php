        <p><strong>Vim</strong> is a text editor written by <strong>Bram Moolenaar</strong> and first released publicly in 1991. Based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Vi', 'IDE'); ?> editor common to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> systems, Vim is designed for use both from a command line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface.</p>
        <p>Bram Moolenaar began working on Vim for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Amiga', 'ITH'); ?> computer in 1988. Moolenaar first publicly released Vim (v1.14) in 1991. Vim was based on an earlier editor, Stevie, for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Atari ST', 'ITH'); ?>, created by Tim Thompson, Tony Andrews and G. R. Walter.</p>
        <p>The name Vim is an acronym for "<strong>V</strong>i <strong>IM</strong>proved" because Vim is an extended version of the vi editor.</p>
