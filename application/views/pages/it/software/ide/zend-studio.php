        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Zend Studio'); ?>
        <p><strong>Zend Studio</strong> is a commercial, proprietary integrated development environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'IT'); ?>) for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PHP', 'L'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Zend Technologies', 'C'); ?>, based on the <strong>PHP Development Tools (PDT)</strong> plugin for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Eclipse', 'SWI'); ?> platform (the PDT project is led by Zend).</p>
        <p>Zend Studio is tightly integrated with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Zend Server', 'WS'); ?>, Zend's pre-integrated, tested PHP application stack. The integration enables developers to quickly set up a complete PHP environment and speed up root cause analysis of problems detected in testing or in the production environment.</p>
        <p>Zend Studio is also integrated with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Zend Framework', 'PHPF'); ?>. For example, it provides an MVC view for easy code navigation and integration with Zend_Tool for automated code generation.<p>
