        <p><strong>Microsoft Visual Web Developer Express</strong> is a freeware web development tool, that allows developers to evaluate the web development and editing capabilities of the other <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual Studio', 'IDE'); ?> editions at no charge.</p>
        <p>Its main function is to create <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ASP.NET', 'L'); ?> websites.</p>
        <p>It has a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WYSIWYG', 'IT'); ?> interface, drag-and-drop user interface designer, enhanced <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> and code editors, a limited database explorer, support for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?>, and integrated, design time validation for standards including XHTML 1.0/1.1 and CSS 2.1.</p>
