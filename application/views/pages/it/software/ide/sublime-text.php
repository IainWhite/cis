        <p><strong>Sublime Text</strong> is a cross-platform text and source code editor with a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Python', 'L'); ?> application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.</p>
        <p>Sublime Text is proprietary software. Despite users enhancing the software with free add-ons, all license revenue accrues to the primary developer.</p>
