        <p><strong>Microsoft FrontPage</strong> is a discontinued <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WYSIWYG', 'IT'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> editor and Web site administration tool from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> line of operating systems.</p>
        <p>It was branded as part of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Office', 'ITS'); ?> suite from 1997 to 2003.</p>
        <p>Microsoft FrontPage has since been replaced by <strong>Microsoft Expression Web</strong> and <strong>SharePoint Designer</strong>, which were first released in December 2006 alongside Microsoft Office 2007.</p>
        <p>FrontPage was initially created by the Cambridge, Massachusetts company <strong>Vermeer Technologies</strong>, Incorporated, evidence of which can be easily spotted in file names and directories prefixed <code>_vti_</code> in Web sites created using FrontPage.</p>
        <p>Vermeer was acquired by Microsoft in January 1996 specifically so that Microsoft could add FrontPage to its product line-up allowing them to gain an advantage in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('browser wars', 'WD'); ?>, as FrontPage was designed to create web pages for their own browser, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>As a "<em>WYSIWYG</em>" (<em>What You See Is What You Get</em>) editor, FrontPage is designed to hide the details of pages HTML code from the user, making it possible for novices to create Web pages and Web sites easily.</p>
        <p>FrontPage's initial outing under the Microsoft name came in 1996 with the release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft NT 4.0 Server', 'WIS'); ?> and its constituent Web server <strong>Internet Information Services (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IIS', 'WS'); ?>) 2.0</strong>.</p>
        <p>Bundled on CD with the NT 4.0 Server release, FrontPage 1.1 would run under NT 4.0 (Server or Workstation) or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Up to FrontPage 98, the FrontPage Editor, which was used for designing pages was a separate application from the FrontPage Explorer which was used to manage Web site folders. With FrontPage 2000, both programs were merged into the Editor.</p>
        <p>FrontPage used to require a set of server-side plugins originally known as IIS Extensions.</p>
        <p>The extension set was significantly enhanced for Microsoft inclusion of FrontPage into the Microsoft Office line-up with Office 97 and subsequently renamed <strong>FrontPage Server Extensions</strong> (<strong>FPSE</strong>).</p>
        <p>Both sets of extensions needed to be installed on the target Web server for its content and publishing features to work.</p>
        <p>Microsoft offered both Windows and Unix-based versions of FPSE.</p>
        <p>FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions worked with earlier versions of FrontPage as well.</p>
        <p>FPSE 2002 was the last released version which also works with FrontPage 2003 and was later updated for IIS 6.0 as well.</p>
        <p>However, with FrontPage 2003, Microsoft began moving away from proprietary Server Extensions to standard protocols like <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FTP', 'IPA'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebDav', 'WD'); ?> for remote Web publishing and authoring.</p>
        <p>FrontPage 2003 can also be used with <strong>Windows SharePoint Services</strong>.</p>
