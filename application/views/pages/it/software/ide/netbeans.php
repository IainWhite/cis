        <p><strong>NetBeans</strong> is an Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'ITS'); ?>) for developing primarily with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?>, but also with other languages, in particular <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PHP', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++', 'LC'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML5', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It is also an application platform framework for Java desktop applications and others.</p>
        <p>The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Solaris', 'OS'); ?> and other platforms supporting a compatible <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JVM', 'LJ'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The NetBeans Platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules.</p>
        <p>Applications based on the NetBeans Platform (including the NetBeans IDE itself) can be extended by third party developers.</p>
