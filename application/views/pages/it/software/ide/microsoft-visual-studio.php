        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Microsoft Visual Studio'); ?>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong> is an Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'ITS'); ?>) from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It is used to develop computer programs for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> family of operating systems, as well as web sites, web applications and web services.</p>
        <p>Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows API', 'SD'); ?>, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight.</p>
        <p>It can produce both native code and managed code.</p>
        <p>Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense as well as code refactoring.</p>
        <p>The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger.</p>
        <p>Other built-in tools include a forms designer for building <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?> applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer.</p>
        <p>It accepts plug-ins that enhance the functionality at almost every level-including adding support for source-control systems (like <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Subversion', 'SD'); ?>) and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Team Foundation Server client: Team Explorer).</p>
        <p>Visual Studio supports different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language specific service exists.</p>
        <p>Built in languages include <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++', 'CL'); ?> and C++/CLI (via <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual C++', 'CL'); ?>), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VB.NET', 'L'); ?> (via Visual Basic.NET), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C#', 'LC'); ?> (via Visual C#), and F# (as of Visual Studio 2010).</p>
        <p>Support for other languages such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Python', 'L'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ruby', 'L'); ?> among others is available via language services installed separately.</p>
        <p>It also supports <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
