        <p><strong>PC Tools</strong> was a collection of software utilities developed by <strong>Central Point Software</strong>.</p>
        <p>The original PC Tools package was first developed as a suite of utilities for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>, released for retail in 1986.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of version 4.0, the name was changed to <strong>PC Tools Deluxe</strong>, and the primary interface became a colourful graphical DOS shell (previously the DOS shell resembled PC BOSS and was monochrome).</p>
        <p>By version 7.0 of the package in 1991 several <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> programs had been added to it.</p>
        <p>Though the 7.0 version sold well, it was criticised in computer trade publications for being overly complicated and riddled with bugs.</p>
        <p>It was widely considered to have been rushed to publication, despite the objections of many of Central Point Software's employees.</p>
        <p>PC Tools Version 9.x for DOS was the last stable release.</p>
        <p>In June 1994 Central Point was acquired by their top competitor <strong>Symantec</strong> who ultimately discontinued the product line.</p>
        <p>PC Tools was the main competitor to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Norton Utilities', 'ITS'); ?>, which Symantec had acquired in 1990.</p>
