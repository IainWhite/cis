        <p><strong>Midnight Commander</strong> (also known as <code>mc</code>, the command used to start it) is a free cross-platform orthodox file manager and a clone of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Norton Commander', 'ITS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It was started by <strong>Miguel de Icaza</strong> in 1994.</p>
        <p>Midnight Commander is a console application with a text user interface.</p>
        <p>The main interface consists of two panels which display the file system.</p>
        <p>File selection is done using arrow keys, the insert key is used to select files and the function keys perform operations such as renaming, editing and copying files.</p>
        <p>Later versions of the Midnight Commander additionally have mouse support. Such versions are aware of GPM and X terminal emulators (such as GNOME Terminal or xterm) which support mouse reporting.</p>
        <p>When running inside an X terminal, these versions can update the name of the window in which Midnight Commander runs (if allowed by the terminal emulator).</p>
        <p>Midnight Commander's features include the ability to view the contents of RPM package files, to work with common archive formats as if they were simply another directory, and to function as an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FTP', 'IPA'); ?> or FISH client.</p>
        <p>Midnight Commander also includes an editor called <code>mcedit</code>, which can be executed as a standalone program or from Midnight Commander using the F4 key. mcedit's features include syntax highlighting for many languages, macros, code snippets, simple integration with external tools, automatic indentation, mouse support, a clipboard and the ability to work in both ASCII and hex modes.</p>
