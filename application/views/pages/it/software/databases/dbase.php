        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('dBase'); ?>
        <p><strong>dBase</strong> (also stylised <strong>dBASE</strong>) was one of the first and in its day the most successful database management systems for microcomputers.</p>
        <p>The dBase system includes the core database engine, a query system, a forms engine, and a programming language that ties all of these components together.</p>
        <p>dBase's underlying file format, the <code>.dbf</code> file, is widely used in applications needing a simple format to store structured data.</p>
        <p>dBase was originally published by <strong>Ashton-Tate</strong> for microcomputer operating system <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?>. in 1980, and later ported to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple II', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'ITH'); ?> computers running <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>On the PC platform, in particular, dBase became one of the best selling software titles for a number of years.</p>
        <p>A major upgrade was released as dBase III, and ported to a wider variety of platforms, adding <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UNIX', 'OS'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VMS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>By the mid 1980s, Ashton-Tate was one of the "<em>big three</em>" software publishers in the early business software market, the others being <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus Development', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WordPerfect', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Starting in the mid 1980s, several companies produced their own variations on the dBase product and especially the dBase programming language.</p>
        <p>These included <strong>FoxBASE+</strong> (later renamed <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FoxPro', 'DB'); ?>), <strong>Clipper</strong>, and other so called xBase products.</p>
        <p>Many of these were technically stronger than dBase, but could not push it aside in the market. This changed with the disastrous introduction of dBase IV, whose design and stability were so poor many users switched to other products.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there was growing use of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SQL', 'DB'); ?> (<strong>Structured Query Language</strong>) in database products.</p>
        <p>Another factor was user adoption of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> on desktop computers.</p>
