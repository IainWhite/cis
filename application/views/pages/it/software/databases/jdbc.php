        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('JDBC - Java Database Connectivity'); ?>
        <p><strong>JDBC</strong> is a Java database connectivity technology (Java Standard Edition platform) from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Oracle Corporation', 'C'); ?>. This technology is an API for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> programming language that defines how a client may access a database. It provides methods for querying and updating data in a database. JDBC is oriented towards relational databases. A JDBC to ODBC bridge enables connections to any ODBC-accessible data source in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JVM', 'LJ'); ?> host environment.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sun Microsystems', 'C'); ?> released JDBC as part of JDK 1.1 on 19 February 1997. Since then it has been part of the Java Standard Edition.</p>
        <p>The JDBC classes are contained in the Java package <code>java.sql</code> and <code>javax.sql</code>.</p>
        <p>Starting with version 3.1, JDBC has been developed under the Java Community Process. JSR 54 specifies JDBC 3.0 (included in J2SE 1.4), JSR 114 specifies the JDBC Rowset additions, and JSR 221 is the specification of JDBC 4.0 (included in Java SE 6).</p>
        <p>JDBC 4.1, is specified by a maintenance release 1 of JSR 221 and is included in Java SE 7.</p>
        <p>The latest version, JDBC 4.2, is specified by a maintenance release 2 of JSR 221 and is included in Java SE 8.</p>
