        <p><strong>IBM DB2</strong> is a family of database server products developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>These products all support the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('relational model', 'DB'); ?>, but in recent years some products have been extended to support object-relational features and non-relational structures, in particular <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Historically and unlike other database vendors, IBM produced a platform-specific DB2 product for each of its major operating systems.</p>
        <p>However, in the 1990s IBM changed track and produced a DB2 "common server" product, designed with a common code base to run on different platforms.</p>
