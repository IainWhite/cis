        <p>The <strong>Call Level Interface</strong> (<strong>CLI</strong>) is a software standard defined in ISO/IEC 9075-3:2003.</p>
        <p>The Call Level Interface defines how a program should send <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SQL', 'DB'); ?> queries to the database management system (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DBMS', 'DB'); ?>) and how the returned recordsets should be handled by the application in a consistent way.</p>
        <p>Developed in the early 1990s, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('API', 'IT'); ?> was defined only for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('COBOL', 'L'); ?> programming languages.</p>
        <p>SQL / CLI provides an international standard implementation-independent CLI to access SQL databases. Client-server tools can easily access databases through Dynamic link libraries (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DLL', 'IT'); ?>).</p>
        <p>The most widespread use of the CLI standard is the basis of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ODBC', 'DB'); ?> (Open Database Connectivity) specification, which is widely used to allow applications to transparently access database systems from different vendors.</p>
