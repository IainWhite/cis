        <p><strong>Transact-SQL</strong> (<strong>T-SQL</strong>) is <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>'s proprietary extension to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SQL', 'DB'); ?>.</p>
        <p><strong>SQL</strong>, the acronym for <strong>S</strong>tructured <strong>Q</strong>uery <strong>L</strong>anguage, is a standardized computer language that was originally developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> for querying, altering and defining relational databases, using declarative statements.</p>
        <p>T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the <code>DELETE</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> statements.</p>
        <p>These additional features make Transact-SQL Turing complete.</p>
        <p>T-SQL is central to using <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft SQL Server', 'DB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.</p>
