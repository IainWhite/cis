        <p><strong>MongoDB</strong> (from "humongous") is a cross-platform document oriented database.</p>
        <p>Classified as a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NoSQL', 'DB'); ?> database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table based relational database structure in favour of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JSON', 'WD'); ?> like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format <strong>BSON</strong>), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.</p>
        <p>Released under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.</p>
        <p>First developed by the software company <strong>10gen</strong> (now <strong>MongoDB Inc</strong>) in October 2007 as a component of a planned platform as a service product, the company shifted to an open source development model in 2009, with 10gen offering commercial support and other services.</p>
        <p>Since then, MongoDB has been adopted as back-end software by a number of major websites and services, including Craigslist, eBay, Foursquare, SourceForge, Viacom, and the New York Times, among others.</p>
