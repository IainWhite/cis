        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('SQLite'); ?>
        <p><strong>SQLite</strong> is a Relational Database Management System (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RDBMS', 'DB'); ?>) contained in a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?> programming library.</p>
        <p>In contrast to other database management systems, SQLite is not a separate process that is accessed from the client application, but an integral part of it.</p>
        <p>SQLite is <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ACID', 'DB'); ?> compliant and implements most of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SQL', 'DB'); ?> standard, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity.</p>
