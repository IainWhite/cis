        <p><strong>MariaDB</strong> is a community-developed fork of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MySQL', 'DB'); ?> relational database management system, the impetus being the community maintenance of its free status under the GNU GPL. As a fork of a leading open source software system, it is notable for being led by its original developers and triggered by concerns over direction by an acquiring commercial company <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Oracle', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The intent is also to maintain high compatibility with MySQL, ensuring a "drop-in" replacement capability with library binary equivalency and exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands.</p>
