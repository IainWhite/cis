        <p>A <strong>Relational Database Management System</strong> (<strong>RDBMS</strong>) is a <strong>database management system</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DBMS', 'DB'); ?>) that is based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('relational model', 'IT'); ?> as introduced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('E F Codd', 'P'); ?>, of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>'s San Jose Research Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Many popular databases currently in use are based on the relational database model.</p>
        <p>RDBMSs have become a predominant choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and much more since the 1980s.</p>
        <p>Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are easier to understand and use.</p>
        <p>The three leading open source implementations are <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MySQL', 'DB'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PoestgreSQL', 'DB'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SQLite', 'DB'); ?>.</p>
