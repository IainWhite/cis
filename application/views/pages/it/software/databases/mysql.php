        <p><strong>MySQL</strong> is (as of July 2013) the world's second most widely used open-source relational database management system (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RDBMA', 'DB'); ?>).</p>
        <p>It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, My. The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SQL', 'DB'); ?> phrase stands for <strong>S</strong>tructured <strong>Q</strong>uery <strong>L</strong>anguage.</p>
        <p>The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNU General Public License', 'LIC'); ?>, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Oracle Corporation', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in Web applications, and is a central component of the widely used <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('LAMP', 'WD'); ?> open source web application software stack (and other 'AMP' stacks). <strong>LAMP</strong> is an acronym for "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apache', 'WS'); ?>, MySQL, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PHP', 'L'); ?>".</p>
        <p>Free software open source projects that require a full featured database management system often use MySQL.</p>
