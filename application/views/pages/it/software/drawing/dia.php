        <p><strong>Dia</strong> is free and open source general purpose diagramming software, developed originally by <strong>Alexander Larsson</strong>.</p>
        <p>Dia uses a controlled single document interface (SDI) similar to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GIMP', 'ITS'); ?> and <strong>Inkscape</strong>.</p>
        <p>Dia has a modular design with several shape packages available for different needs: flowchart, network diagrams, circuit diagrams, and more.</p>
        <p>It does not restrict symbols and connectors from various categories from being placed together.</p>
        <p>Dia has special objects to help draw entity-relationship models, <strong>Unified Modeling Language (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UML', 'SD'); ?>)</strong> diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and simple electrical circuits.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XML', 'WD'); ?> files, using a subset of Scalable Vector Graphics (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SVG', 'IT'); ?>) to draw the shape.</p>
        <p>Dia loads and saves diagrams in a custom XML format, which is, by default, gzipped to save space, and can print large diagrams spanning multiple pages.</p>
        <p>It can also be scripted using the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Python', 'L'); ?> programming language.</p>
        <p>Dia was originally created by Alexander Larsson but he moved on to work on GNOME and other projects.</p>
        <p><strong>James Henstridge</strong> then took over as the lead developer, but he also moved on to other projects. He was followed by <strong>Cyrille Chepelov</strong> and <strong>Lars Clausen</strong> in turn.</p>
        <p>Dia is maintained by a group of developers: Hans Breuer, Steffen Macke, and Sameer Sahasrabuddhe.</p>
