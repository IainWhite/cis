        <p><strong>Adobe FreeHand</strong> (formerly <strong>Macromedia Freehand</strong>) is a computer application for creating two dimensional vector graphics that are oriented primarily to professional illustration, desktop publishing and content creation for the Web.</p>
        <p>FreeHand is similar in scope, intended market, and functionality to <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CorelDraw', 'ITS'); ?> and <strong>Xara Designer Pro</strong>. Because of FreeHandâ€™s dedicated page layout and text control features, it also compares to <strong>Adobe InDesign</strong> and <strong>QuarkXPress</strong>.</p>
        <p>FreeHand was created by <strong>Altsys Corporation</strong> in 1988 and licensed to <strong>Aldus Corporation</strong> which released versions 1 through 4.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Aldus merged with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Systems', 'C'); ?> and because of the overlapping market with Adobe Illustrator, FreeHand was returned to Altsys by order of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
        <p>Altsys was later bought by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macromedia', 'C'); ?>, which released FreeHand versions 5 through 11 (FreeHand MX).</p>
        <p>In 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia and its product line which included FreeHand MX, under whose ownership it presently resides.</p>
        <p>Development has been discontinued but it is still sold in versions for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>FreeHand MX continues to run under <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 7', 'WIN'); ?> using compatibility mode and under Mac OS X 10.6 (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Show Leopard', 'OSX'); ?>) within Rosetta, a PowerPC code emulator, and requires a registration patch supplied by Adobe.</p>
        <p>Freehand 10 runs without problems on Mac OS X 10.6 with Rosetta enabled, and does not require a registration patch.</p>
