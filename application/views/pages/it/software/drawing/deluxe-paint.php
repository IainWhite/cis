        <p><strong>Deluxe Paint</strong> (also known as <strong>DPaint</strong>) is a bitmap graphics editor series originally created by <strong>Dan Silva</strong> for <strong>Electronic Arts (EA)</strong>.</p>
        <p>The original Deluxe Paint was created for the <strong>Commodore Amiga 1000</strong>, and released in November 1985. It was eventually ported to other platforms, including a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> version for the PC which became the standard for pixel graphics in computer games in the 1990s, the only competitor being <strong>Autodesk Animator Pro</strong>.</p>
        <p>DPaint began as an in-house art development tool called <em>Prism</em>. As author Dan Silva added features to Prism, it was developed as a showcase product to coincide with the Amiga's debut in 1985. Upon release, it was quickly embraced by the Amiga community and became the defacto graphics (and later animation) editor for the platform.</p>
        <p>It was used almost ubiquitously in the making of Amiga games, animation and demoscene productions. Amiga manufacturer Commodore International later commissioned EA to create version 4.5 AGA to bundle with the new <strong>Advanced Graphics Architecture chipset</strong> (A1200, A4000) capable Amigas. Version 5 was the last release after Commodore's bankruptcy in 1994.</p>
        <p>With the development of Deluxe Paint, EA introduced the ILBM and ANIM file format standards for graphics. While widely used on the Amiga, these formats never gained widespread end user acceptance on other platforms, but were heavily used by game development companies.</p>
        <p>Dpaint was used by <strong>Lucasarts</strong> to make graphics for their adventure games such as <strong>Monkey Island</strong>, and is the source of the name of the main character in the Monkey Island series, <strong>Guybrush Threepwood</strong> - the character's name derived from the file used to store his image data, which was named "<code>guybrush.bbm</code>", the "brush" portion of the file name being included by the artist behind the character, Steve Purcell.</p>
        <p>Early versions of Deluxe Paint were available in protected and non copy-protected versions, the latter retailing for a slightly higher price. The copy-protection scheme was later dropped.</p>
        <p>Deluxe Paint was first in a series of products from the Electronic Arts Tools group then later moved to the ICE (for Interactivity, Creativity, and Education) group which included such Amiga programs as Deluxe Music, Deluxe Video, and the Studio series of paint programs for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
