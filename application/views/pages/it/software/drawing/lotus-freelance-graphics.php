        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Lotus Freelance Graphics'); ?>
        <p><strong>Lotus Freelance Graphics</strong> is an information graphics and presentation program developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus Software', 'C'); ?> following its acquisition of <strong>Graphic Communications Inc</strong> in 1986.</p>
        <p>Lotus Freelance Graphics is a part of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus SmartSuite', 'ITS'); ?> office suite for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It allows users to create and compile text, digital images, diagrams, basic drawings, and charts (such as bar charts and pie charts) into a digital slide show.</p>
        <p>The program was originally an enhancement for the graphing function of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus 1-2-3', 'SS'); ?> spreadsheet based program.</p>
        <p>Freelance worked within <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> to produce slides that were a worthy competitor to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PowerPoint', 'ITS'); ?>, a program that was started for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> system.</p>
        <p>Lotus opted to develop for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?> and got left behind on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> giving <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> a head start.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> then acquired Lotus, Microsoft then used a licensing issue with IBM to delay Lotus and IBM access to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?> code base giving <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Office', 'ITS'); ?> a 6 month head start over <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus SmartSuite', 'ITS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>With the general lack of adoption of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?>, Freelance became a little used system.</p>
