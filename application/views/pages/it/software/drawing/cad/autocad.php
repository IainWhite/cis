        <p><strong>AutoCAD</strong> is a commercial software application for 2D and 3D computer-aided design (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CAD', 'IT'); ?>) and drafting - available since 1982 as a desktop application and since 2010 as a mobile web and cloud-based app marketed as <strong>AutoCAD 360</strong>.</p>
        <p>Developed and marketed by <strong>Autodesk, Inc</strong>, AutoCAD was first released in December 1982, running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers.</p>
        <p>Prior to the introduction of AutoCAD, most commercial CAD programs ran on mainframe computers or minicomputers, with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate graphics terminal.</p>
        <p>AutoCAD is used across a wide range of industries, by architects, project managers, engineers, designers, and other professionals.</p>
        <p>As Autodesk's flagship product, by March 1986 AutoCAD had become the most ubiquitous CAD program worldwide.</p>
        <p>As of 2014, AutoCAD is in its twenty-ninth generation, and collectively with all its variants, continues to be the most widely used CAD program throughout most of the world.</p>
