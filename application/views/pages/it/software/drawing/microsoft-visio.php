        <p><strong>Microsoft Visio</strong> is a diagramming and vector graphics application and is part of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Office', 'ITS'); ?> suite.</p>
        <p>The product was first introduced in 1992, made by the <strong>Shapeware corporation</strong>. It was acquired by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> in 2000.</p>
        <p>Visio began as a standalone product produced by Shapeware Corporation; version 1.0 shipped in 1992.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Shapeware Corporation changed their name to <strong>Visio Corporation</strong> to take advantage of market recognition and related product equity.</p>
        <p>Microsoft acquired Visio in 2000, re-branding it as a Microsoft Office application, like <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Project', 'ITS'); ?>; however, it has never been included in any of the Office suites.</p>
        <p>Microsoft included a <strong>Visio for Enterprise Architects</strong> edition with some editions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual Studio', 'IDE'); ?> .NET 2003 and Visual Studio 2005.</p>
        <p>Along with Microsoft Visio 2002 Professional, Microsoft introduced Visio Enterprise Network Tools and Visio Network Center.</p>
