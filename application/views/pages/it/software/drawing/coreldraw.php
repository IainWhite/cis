        <p><strong>CorelDraw</strong> is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Corel Corporation', 'C'); ?> of Ottawa, Canada.</p>
        <p>It is also the name of Corel's Graphics Suite, which bundles CorelDraw with a bitmap image editor, Corel Photo-Paint, and other graphics related programs.</p>
        <p>In 1987, Corel hired software engineers <strong>Michel Bouillon</strong> and <strong>Pat Beirne</strong> to develop a vector based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems.</p>
        <p>That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989.</p>
        <p>CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x runs under <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 2.x', 'WIN'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('3.0', 'WIN'); ?>. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>'s release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 3.1', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The inclusion of TrueType in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as Adobe Type Manager; paired with a photo editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.</p>
