        <p><strong>Calendar</strong>, known as <strong>iCal</strong> before the release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X Mountain Lion', 'OSX'); ?> in July 2012. Originally released as a free download for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'MOS'); ?> v10.2 on 10 September 2002, it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 1.5 with the release of Mac OS X v10.3. iCal was the first calendar application for OS X to offer support for multiple calendars and the ability to intermittently publish/subscribe to calendars on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebDAV', 'WD'); ?> servers. Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X v10.4, Version 3 as part of Mac OS X v10.5, Version 4 as part of Mac OS X v10.6, Version 5 as part of Mac OS X v10.7, Version 6 as part of OS X v10.8, Version 7 as part of OS X v10.9, and Version 8 as part of OS X v10.10.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> licensed the iCal name from <strong>Brown Bear Software</strong>, who have used it for their iCal application since 1997.</p>
        <p>iCal's initial development was quite different from other Apple software: it was designed independently by a small French team working "secretly" in Paris, led by <strong>Jean-Marie Hullot</strong>, a friend of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Jobs', 'P'); ?>. iCal's development has since been transferred to Apple US headquarters in Cupertino.</p>
