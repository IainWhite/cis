        <p><strong>Lotus Organizer</strong> was a personal information manager (PIM).</p>
        <p>It was initially developed by <strong>Threadz</strong>, a small British software house, reaching version 3.0.</p>
        <p>Organizer was subsequently acquired by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus Development Corporation', 'C'); ?>, for whom the package was a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> based replacement for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus Agenda', 'ITS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>For several years it was the unquestioned market leader until it was gradually overtaken by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Outlook', 'ITS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Organizer is notable for using the "leather-bound personal organizer" graphical metaphor for its user interface.</p>
        <p>It was bundled within <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus SmartSuite', 'ITS'); ?>.</p>
