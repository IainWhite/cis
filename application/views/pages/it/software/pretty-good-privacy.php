        <p><strong>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)</strong> is a data encryption and decryption computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is often used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. It was created by <strong>Phil Zimmermann</strong> in 1991.</p>
        <p>PGP and similar software follow the <strong>OpenPGP</strong> standard (<?php echo $this->stencil->addRFCLink('4880'); ?>) for encrypting and decrypting data.</p>
