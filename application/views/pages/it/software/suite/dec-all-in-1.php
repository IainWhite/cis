        <p><strong>ALL-IN-1</strong> was an office automation product developed and sold by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Equipment Corporation', 'C'); ?> in the 1980s. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HP', 'C'); ?> now maintains the current version <strong>Office Server V3.2</strong> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OpenVMS Alpha', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OpenVMS VAX', 'OS'); ?> systems.</p>
        <p>ALL-IN-1 was advertised as an office automation system including functionality in Electronic Messaging, Word Processing and Time Management. It offered an application development platform and customisation capabilities that ranged from scripting to code-level integration.</p>
        <p>ALL-IN-1 was designed and developed by <strong>Skip Walter</strong>, <strong>John Churin</strong> and <strong>Marty Skinner</strong> from Digital Equipment Corporation who began work in 1977. The first version of the software was called <strong>CP/OSS</strong>, the <strong>Charlotte Package of Office System Services</strong>, named after the location of the developers. In 1983, the product was renamed ALL-IN-1 and the Charlotte group continued to develop versions 1.1 through 1.3.</p>
        <p>Digital then made the decision to move most of the development activity to its central engineering facility in Reading, United Kingdom, where a group there took responsibility for the product from version 2.0 (released in field test in 1984 and to customers in 1985) onward. The Charlotte group continued to work on the Time Management subsystem until version 2.3 and other contributions were made from groups based in Sophia-Antipolis, France (System for Customisation Management and the integration with VAX Notes), Reading (Message Router and MAILbus), and Spitbrook, New Hampshire (FMS). ALL-IN-1 V3.0 introduced shared file cabinets and the File Cabinet Server (FCS) to lay the foundation for an eventual integration with TeamLinks, Digital's PC office client. Previous integrations with PCs included PC ALL-IN-1, a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> based product introduced in 1989 that never proved popular with customers.</p>
