        <p>A <strong>binary code</strong> represents text or computer processor instructions using the binary number system's two binary digits, 0 and 1. A binary code assigns a bit string to each symbol or instruction. For example, a binary string of eight binary digits (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('bits', 'IT'); ?>) can represent any of 256 possible values and can therefore correspond to a variety of different symbols, letters or instruction.</p>
        <p>In computing and telecommunication, binary codes are used for various methods of encoding data, such as character strings, into bit strings. Those methods may use fixed-width or variable-width strings. In a fixed-width binary code, each letter, digit, or other character is represented by a bit string of the same length; that bit string, interpreted as a binary number, is usually displayed in code tables in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('octal', 'IT'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('decimal', 'IT'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('hexadecimal', 'IT'); ?> notation. There are many character sets and many character encodings for them.</p>
        <p>A bit string, interpreted as a binary number, can be translated into a decimal number. For example, the lower case <code>a</code>, if represented by the bit string <code>01100001</code> (as it is in the standard <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ASCII code', 'IT'); ?>), can also be represented as the decimal number 97.</p>
