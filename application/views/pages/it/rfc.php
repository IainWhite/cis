        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('RFC - Request for Comments'); ?>
        <p>A <strong>Request for Comments</strong> (<strong>RFC</strong>) is a publication of the <strong>Internet Engineering Task Force (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IETF', 'C'); ?>)</strong> and the <strong>Internet Society</strong>, the principal technical development and standards setting bodies for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>An RFC is authored by engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviours, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet connected systems.</p>
        <p>It is submitted either for peer review or simply to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humour.</p>
        <p>The IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFCs as Internet standards.</p>
        <p>Request for Comments documents were invented by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Stephen Crocker', 'P'); ?> in 1969 to help record unofficial notes on the development of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ARPANET', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>RFCs have since become official documents of Internet specifications, communications protocols, procedures, and events.</p>
