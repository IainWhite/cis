        <p>The <strong>iTunes Store</strong>, originally the <strong>iTunes Music Store</strong>, is a software based online digital media store operated by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. It opened on 28 April 2003, and has been the largest music vendor in the United States since April 2008, and the largest music vendor in the world since February 2010. It offers over 37 million songs, 700,000 apps, 190,000 TV episodes and 45,000 films as of 12 September 2012. The iTunes Store's revenues in the first quarter of 2011 totalled nearly US$1.4 billion, by 6 February 2013, the store had sold 25 billion songs worldwide.</p>
        <p>While most downloaded files initially included usage restrictions enforced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FairPlay', 'IT'); ?>, Apple's implementation of digital rights management (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DRM', 'IT'); ?>), iTunes later initiated a shift into selling DRM free music in most countries, marketed as iTunes Plus. On 6 January 2009, Apple announced that DRM had been removed from 80% of its music catalog in the US. Full iTunes Plus availability was achieved in the US on 7 April 2009, coinciding with the introduction of a three-tiered pricing model; however, television episodes, many books, and films are still FairPlay protected. As of June 2013, the iTunes Store possesses 575 million active user accounts, and serves over 315 million mobile devices, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Watches', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPods', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhones', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple TV', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPads', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
