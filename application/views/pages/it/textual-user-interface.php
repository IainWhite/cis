        <p><strong>Text-based User Interface (TUI)</strong>, also called <strong>Textual User Interface</strong> or <strong>Terminal User Interface</strong>, is a retronym that was coined sometime after the invention of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Graphical User Interfaces', 'IT'); ?>, to distinguish a text-based interface that processed events from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Command Line Interfaces', 'IT'); ?> that operate sequentially. An advanced TUI may, like GUIs, use the entire screen area and accept mouse input. A TUI does not necessarily provide line-by-line output, although TUIs only use text, symbols and colours available on a given text environment.</p>
