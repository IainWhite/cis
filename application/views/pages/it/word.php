        <p>In computing, <strong>word</strong> is a term for the natural unit of data used by a particular processor design. A word is a fixed-sized piece of data handled as a unit by the instruction set or the hardware of the processor. The number of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('bits', 'IT'); ?> in a word (the word size, word width, or word length) is an important characteristic of any specific processor design or computer architecture.</p>
