        <p>A <strong>Caesar cipher</strong>, also known as <strong>Caesar's cipher</strong>, <strong>the shift cipher</strong>, <strong>Caesar's code</strong> or <strong>Caesar shift</strong>, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after <strong>Julius Caesar</strong>, who used it in his private correspondence.</p>
        <p>The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the <strong>Vigen√®re cipher</strong>, and still has modern application in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ROT13', 'IT'); ?> system. As with all single alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communication security.</p>
