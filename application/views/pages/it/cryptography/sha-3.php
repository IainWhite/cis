        <p><strong>SHA-3</strong>, a subset of the cryptographic primitive family <strong>Keccak</strong>  is a cryptographic hash function designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michaël Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche, building upon RadioGatún.</p>
        <p>On 2 October 2012, Keccak was selected as the winner of the NIST hash function competition. SHA-3 is not meant to replace <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SHA-2', 'IT'); ?>, as no significant attack on SHA-2 has been demonstrated. Because of the successful attacks on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MD5', 'IT'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SHA-0', 'IT'); ?> and theoretical attacks on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SHA-1', 'IT'); ?>,  NIST perceived a need for an alternative, dissimilar cryptographic hash, which became SHA-3.</p>
        <p>In 2014, the NIST has published a draft FIPS 202 "SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions". The standardisation process is in progress as of April 2015.</p>
