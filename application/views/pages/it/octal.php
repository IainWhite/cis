        <p>The <strong>octal</strong> numeral system, or <strong>oct</strong> for short, is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7. Octal numerals can be made from binary numerals by grouping consecutive binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right). For example, the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010, which can be grouped into (00)1 001 010 â€“ so the octal representation is 112.</p>
