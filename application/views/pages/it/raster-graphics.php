        <p>In computer graphics, a <strong>raster graphics</strong> image is a dot matrix data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels, or points of color, viewable via a monitor, paper, or other display medium. Raster images are stored in image files with varying format.</p>
        <p>A bitmap, a single-bit raster, corresponds bit-for-bit with an image displayed on a screen, generally in the same format used for storage in the display's video memory, or maybe as a device-independent bitmap. A raster is technically characterised by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel (a colour depth, which determines the number of colours it can represent).</p>
        <p>The printing and prepress industries know raster graphics as contones (from "continuous tones"). The opposite to contones is "line work", usually implemented as vector graphics in digital systems.</p>
