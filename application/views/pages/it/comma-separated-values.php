        <p>A <strong>Comma Separated Values</strong> (<strong>CSV</strong>) (also sometimes called character separated values, because the separator character does not have to be a comma) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text form.</p>
        <p>Plain text means that the file is a sequence of characters, with no data that has to be interpreted instead, as binary numbers.</p>
        <p>A CSV file consists of any number of records, separated by line breaks of some kind; each record consists of fields, separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal comma or tab. Usually, all records have an identical sequence of fields.</p>
