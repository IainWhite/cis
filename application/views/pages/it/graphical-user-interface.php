        <p>A <strong>Graphical User Interface</strong> (<strong>GUI</strong>, sometimes pronounced "<em>gooey</em>" or "<em>gwee</em>") is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('text based interfaces', 'IT'); ?>, typed command labels or text navigation.</p>
        <p>GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of <strong>Command-Line Interfaces (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CLI', 'IT'); ?>)</strong>, which require commands to be typed on the keyboard.</p>
        <p>A GUI uses a combination of technologies and devices to provide a platform that the user can interact with, for the tasks of gathering and producing information.</p>
        <p>A series of elements conforming a visual language have evolved to represent information stored in computers. This makes it easier for people with few computer skills to work with and use computer software.</p>
        <p>The most common combination of such elements in GUIs is the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WIMP', 'IT'); ?> ("Window, Icon, Menu, Pointing device") paradigm, especially in personal computers.</p>
        <p>The WIMP style of interaction uses a virtual input device to control the position of a pointer, most often a mouse, and presents information organized in windows and represented with icons.</p>
        <p>Available commands are compiled together in menus, and actions are performed making gestures with the pointing device.</p>
        <p>A window manager facilitates the interactions between windows, applications, and the windowing system. The windowing system handles hardware devices such as pointing devices and graphics hardware, as well as the positioning of the pointer.</p>
        <p>In personal computers all these elements are modelled through a desktop metaphor, to produce a simulation called a desktop environment in which the display represents a desktop, upon which documents and folders of documents can be placed.</p>
        <p>Window managers and other software combine to simulate the desktop environment with varying degrees of realism.</p>
