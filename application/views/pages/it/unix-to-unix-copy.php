        <p><strong>UUCP</strong> is an abbreviation of <strong>Unix-to-Unix Copy</strong>.</p>
        <p>The term generally refers to a suite of computer programs and protocols allowing remote execution of commands and transfer of files, email and netnews between computers.</p>
        <p>Specifically, a command named uucp is one of the programs in the suite; it provides a user interface for requesting file copy operations.</p>
        <p>Some versions of the suite include uuencode/uudecode (convert 8-bit binary files to 7-bit text format and vice versa).</p>
        <p>Although UUCP was originally developed on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> in the 1970s and 1980s, and is most closely associated with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix-like', 'OS'); ?> systems, UUCP implementations exist for several non-Unix like operating systems, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VAX/VMS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore', 'C'); ?>'s AmigaOS, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('classic Mac OS', 'OS'); ?>, and even <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
