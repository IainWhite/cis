        <p><strong>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</strong> is a class of copy protection technologies that are used by hardware and software manufacturers, publishers, copyright holders, and individuals with the intent to control the use of digital content and devices after sale; there are, however, many competing definitions. With first generation DRM software, the intent is to control copying; with second generation DRM, the intent is to control executing, viewing, copying, printing, and altering of works or devices. The term is also sometimes referred to as copy protection, copy prevention, and copy control, although the correctness of doing so is disputed. DRM is a set of access control technologies. In 1998, the <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Millenium Copyright Act', 'IT'); ?> (DMCA)</strong> was passed in the United States to impose criminal penalties on those who make available technologies whose primary purpose and function are to circumvent content protection technologies.</p>
        <p>The use of digital rights management is not universally accepted. Some content providers claim that DRM is necessary to fight copyright infringement and that it can help the copyright holder maintain artistic control or ensure continued revenue streams. Proponents argue that digital locks should be considered necessary to prevent "intellectual property" from being copied freely, just as physical locks are needed to prevent personal property from being stolen. Those opposed to DRM contend there is no evidence that DRM helps prevent copyright infringement, arguing instead that it serves only to inconvenience legitimate customers, and that DRM helps big business stifle innovation and competition. Furthermore, works can become permanently inaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or if the service is discontinued.</p>
        <p>Digital locks placed in accordance with DRM policies can also restrict users from exercising their legal rights under copyright law, such as backing up copies of CDs or DVDs, lending materials out through a library, accessing works in the public domain, or using copyrighted materials for research and education under the US fair use laws, and under French law. The <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Electronic Frontier Foundation', 'C'); ?> (EFF)</strong> and the <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Free Software Foundation', 'C'); ?> (FSF)</strong> consider the use of DRM systems to be anti-competitive practice.</p>
