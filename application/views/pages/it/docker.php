        <p><strong>Docker</strong> is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating systemâ€“level virtualization on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
