        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Octet'); ?>
        <p>An <strong>octet</strong> is a unit of digital information in computing and telecommunications that consists of eight bits. The term is often used when the term <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Byte', 'IT'); ?> might be ambiguous, as historically there was no standard definition for the size of the byte.</p>
        <p>The unit byte is platform dependent and has represented various storage sizes in the history of computing. However, due to the influence of several major computer architectures and product lines, the byte became overwhelmingly associated with 8 bits. This meaning of byte is codified in such standards as ISO/IEC 80000-13. While to most people today, byte and octet are synonymous, those working with certain legacy systems are careful to avoid ambiguity.</p>
        <p>A variable length sequence of octets, as in <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Abstract Syntax Notation One', 'IT'); ?> (ASN.1)</strong>, is referred to as an octet string.</p>
        <p>The international standard IEC 60027-2, chapter 3.8.2, says that a byte is an octet of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('bits', 'IT'); ?>.</p>
