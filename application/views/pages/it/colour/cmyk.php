        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('CMYK Colour Model'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>CMYK colour model</strong> (process colour, four colour) is a subtractive colour model, used in colour printing, and is also used to describe the printing process itself.</p>
        <p>CMYK refers to the four inks used in some colour printing: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black).</p>
        <p>Though it varies by print house, press operator, press manufacturer, and press run, ink is typically applied in the order of the abbreviation.</p>
        <p>The "K" in CMYK stands for key because in four-colour printing, cyan, magenta, and yellow printing plates are carefully keyed, or aligned, with the key of the black key plate.</p>
        <p>Some sources suggest that the "K" in CMYK comes from the last letter in "black" and was chosen because B already means blue. However, this explanation, although useful as a mnemonic, is incorrect.</p>
        <p>The CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking colours on a lighter, usually white, background.</p>
        <p>The ink reduces the light that would otherwise be reflected. Such a model is called subtractive because inks "subtract" brightness from white.</p>
        <p>In additive colour models such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RGB', 'IT'); ?>, white is the "additive" combination of all primary coloured lights, while black is the absence of light. In the CMYK model, it is the opposite: white is the natural colour of the paper or other background, while black results from a full combination of coloured inks.</p>
        <p>To save money on ink, and to produce deeper black tones, unsaturated and dark colours are produced by using black ink instead of the combination of cyan, magenta and yellow.</p>
