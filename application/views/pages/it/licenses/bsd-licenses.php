        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('BSD licenses'); ?>
        <p><strong>BSD licenses</strong> are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('copyright', 'LIC'); ?> licenses, which have reciprocity [share-alike] requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BSD', 'IT'); ?>), a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix-like', 'OS'); ?> operating system. The original version has since been revised and its descendants are more properly termed modified BSD licenses.</p>
        <p>Two variants of the license, the New BSD License/Modified BSD License (3-clause), and the Simplified BSD License/FreeBSD License (2-clause) have been verified as GPL-compatible free software licenses by the Free Software Foundation, and have been vetted as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative, while the original, 4-clause license has not been accepted as an open source license and, although the original is considered to be a free software license by the FSF, the FSF does not consider it to be compatible with the GPL due to the advertising clause.</p>
