        <p><strong>Share-alike</strong> is a copyright licensing term, originally used by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Creative Commons', 'C'); ?> project, to describe works or licences that require copies or adaptations of the work to be released under the same or similar licence as the original. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Copyleft', 'LIC'); ?> licences are free content or free software licences with a share-alike condition.</p>
        <p>Two currently supported Creative Commons licences have the ShareAlike condition: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (a copyleft, free content licence) and Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (a proprietary licence).</p>
        <p>The term has also been used outside of copyright law to refer to a similar plan for patent licensing.</p>
