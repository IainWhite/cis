        <p>A <strong>computer network</strong> or <strong>data network</strong> is a telecommunications network that allows computers to exchange data.</p>
        <p>In computer networks, networked computing devices pass data to each other along data connections.</p>
        <p>The connections (network links) between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media.</p>
        <p>The best known computer network is the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes.</p>
        <p>Nodes can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, servers as well as networking hardware.</p>
        <p>Two such devices are said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other.</p>
        <p>Computer networks support applications such as access to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?>, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('email', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('instant messaging', 'WD'); ?> applications.</p>
        <p>Computer networks differ in the physical media used to transmit their signals, the communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network's size, topology and organizational intent.</p>
