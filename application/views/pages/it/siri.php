        <p><strong>Siri</strong> is a part of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> which works as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator. The feature uses a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Web services such as Wolfram Alpha. The software, both in its original version and as an iOS feature, adapts to the user's individual language usage and individual searches (preferences) with continuing use, and returns results that are individualised. The name <em>Siri</em> is Scandinavian, a short form of the Norse name <em>Sigrid</em> meaning "<em>beauty</em>" and "<em>victory</em>", and comes from the intended name for the original developer's first child.</p>
        <p>Siri was originally introduced as an iOS application available in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('App Store', 'MD'); ?> by <strong>Siri Inc</strong>, which was acquired by Apple on 28 April 2010. Siri Inc had announced that their software would be available for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BlackBerry', 'C'); ?> and for phones running <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>, but all development efforts for non-Apple platforms were cancelled after the acquisition by Apple.</p>
        <p>Siri has been an integral part of iOS since <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS 5', 'OS'); ?> and was introduced as a feature of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 4S', 'ITH'); ?> on 14 October 2011. Dictation powered by Siri was added to the third generation iPad with the release of iOS 5.1.1 in May 2012; full Siri support was added with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS 6', 'OS'); ?>. The 5th generation <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPod touch', 'ITH'); ?>, released in October 2012, also gained Siri support. Siri has been included on all mobile Apple hardware manufactured during or after October 2012.</p>
        <p>Siri is also integrated into <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Watch', 'ITH'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('watchOS', 'OS'); ?>, and can be activated by holding down the Digital Crown or by saying "<em><Hey, Siri</em>".</p>
