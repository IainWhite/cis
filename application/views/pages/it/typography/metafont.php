        <p><strong>Metafont</strong> is a description language used to define vector fonts.</p>
        <p>It is also the name of the interpreter that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PostScript', 'L'); ?>. Metafont was devised by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Donald Knuth', 'P'); ?> as counterpart to his <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TeX', 'ITS'); ?> typesetting system.</p>
        <p>One of the characteristics of Metafont is that all of the shapes of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('glyphs', 'IT'); ?> are defined with geometrical equations.</p>
        <p>In particular, one can define a given point to be the intersection of a line segment and a B&eacute;zier cubic.</p>
