        <p>In <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('typography', 'IT'); ?>, a <strong>typeface</strong> (also known as <strong>font family</strong>) is a set of one or more <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('fonts', 'IT'); ?> each composed of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('glyphs', 'IT'); ?> that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicisation, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts).</p>
        <p>There are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly.</p>
        <p>The art and craft of designing typefaces is called type design.</p>
        <p>Designers of typefaces are called type designers and are often employed by type foundries.</p>
        <p>In digital typography, type designers are sometimes also called font developers or font designers.</p>
        <p>Every typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. The same glyph may be used for characters from different scripts, e.g. Roman uppercase A looks the same as Cyrillic uppercase –ê and Greek uppercase alpha. There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as map making or astrology and mathematics.</p>
        <p>The term typeface is frequently confused with the term font. Before the advent of digital typography and desktop publishing, the two terms had more clearly understood meanings.</p>
