        <p><strong>Apple Watch</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('smartwatch', 'ITH'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. It incorporates fitness tracking and health oriented capabilities as well as integration with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> and other Apple products and services. The device is available in three "collections": Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, and Apple Watch Edition. The watch is distinguished by different combinations of cases and first or third party interchangeable bands. Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?> (5 or above) to perform many of its default functions (e.g. calling and texting). It is compatible with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5', 'ITH'); ?> or later models running <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS 8.2', 'OS'); ?> or later, through the use of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bluetooth', 'IT'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi', 'ITN'); ?>. Announced by Tim Cook on 9 September 2014, the device was available for pre-order on 10 April and began shipping on 24 April 2015. Apple Watch became World's leading seller of wearables with the shipment of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of 2015, according to analyst outfit Canalys.</p>
