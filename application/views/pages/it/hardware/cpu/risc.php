        <p><strong>Reduced Instruction Set Computing</strong>, or <strong>RISC</strong>, is a CPU design strategy based on the insight that simplified (as opposed to complex) instructions can provide higher performance if this simplicity enables much faster execution of each instruction.</p>
        <p>A computer based on this strategy is a reduced instruction set computer, also called RISC. The opposing architecture is called <strong>Complex Instruction Set Computing</strong> or <strong>CISC</strong>.</p>
        <p>Various suggestions have been made regarding a precise definition of RISC, but the general concept is that of a system that uses a small, highly optimized set of instructions, rather than a more specialized set of instructions often found in other types of architectures.</p>
        <p>Another common trait is that RISC systems use the load/store architecture, where memory is normally accessed only through specific instructions, rather than accessed as part of other instructions like add.</p>
