        <p>In computer engineering and computer science, <strong>microarchitecture</strong>, also called computer organisation, is the way a given Instruction Set Architecture (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ISA', 'ITH'); ?>) is implemented on a processor A given ISA may be implemented with different microarchitectures; implementations may vary due to different goals of a given design or due to shifts in technology.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Computer architecture', 'ITH'); ?> is the combination of microarchitecture and instruction set designs.</p>
