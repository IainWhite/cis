        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('x86 Compatible'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>x86</strong> is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8086', 'CPU'); ?> CPU.</p>
        <p>The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8080', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address.</p>
        <p>The term "x86" came to being because the names of several successors to the Intel's 8086 processor ended in "86", including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('80186', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('80286', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('80386', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('80486', 'CPU'); ?> processors.</p>
