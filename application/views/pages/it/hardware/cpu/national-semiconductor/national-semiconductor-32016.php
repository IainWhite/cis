        <p>The <strong>320xx</strong> or <strong>NS32000</strong> was a series of microprocessors from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('national Semiconductor', 'C'); ?>. They were likely the first <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('32-bit', 'IT'); ?> general purpose microprocessors on the market, but due to a number of factors never managed to become a major player. The 320xx series was also used as the basis of the <strong>Swordfish</strong> microcontroller. It was replaced by the <strong>CompactRISC</strong> architecture in mid 1990.</p>
