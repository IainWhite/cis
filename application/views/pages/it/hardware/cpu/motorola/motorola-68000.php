        <p>The <strong>Motorola 680x0/m68000/68000</strong> is a family of 32-bit CISC microprocessors.</p>
        <p>During the 1980s and early 1990s, they were popular in personal computers and workstations and were the primary competitors of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessors.</p>
        <p>They were most well known as the processors powering the early <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?>, the Commodore Amiga, the Sinclair QL, the Atari ST, the WeatherStar, the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis.</p>
        <p>Although no modern desktop computers are based on the 68000, derivative processors are still widely used in embedded applications.</p>
