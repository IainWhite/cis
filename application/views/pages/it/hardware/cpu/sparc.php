        <p><strong>SPARC</strong> (from "<strong>S</strong>calable <strong>P</strong>rocessor <strong>ARC</strong>hitecture") is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RISC', 'CPU'); ?> instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sun Microsystems', 'C'); ?> and introduced in mid 1987.</p>
        <p>SPARC is a registered trademark of <strong>SPARC International Inc</strong>, an organization established in 1989 to promote the SPARC architecture, manage SPARC trademarks, and provide conformance testing.</p>
        <p>Implementations of the original <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('32-bit', 'IT'); ?> SPARC architecture were initially designed and used in Sun's <strong>Sun-4</strong> workstation and server systems, replacing their earlier <strong>Sun-3</strong> systems based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 68000', 'CPU'); ?> family of processors.</p>
        <p>Later, SPARC processors were used in SMP and CC-NUMA servers produced by Sun, Solbourne and Fujitsu, among others, and designed for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('64-bit', 'IT'); ?> operation.</p>
        <p>SPARC International was intended to open the SPARC architecture to make a larger ecosystem for the design, which has been licensed to several manufacturers, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('texas Instruments', 'C'); ?>, Atmel, Cypress Semiconductor, and Fujitsu.</p>
        <p>As a result of SPARC International, the SPARC architecture is fully open and non-proprietary.</p>
        <p>In March 2006 the complete design of Sun's <strong>UltraSPARC T1</strong> microprocessor was released in open-source form at OpenSPARC.net and named the OpenSPARC T1.</p>
        <p>In 2007 the design of Sun's UltraSPARC T2 microprocessor was also released in open-source form as OpenSPARC T2.</p>
