        <p><strong>Pentium</strong> is a brand used for a series of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86-compatible', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessors produced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>In its most current form, a Pentium processor is a consumer-level product that Intel rates as "two stars", meaning that it is above the low-end Atom and Celeron products but below the faster Core i3, i5 and i7 lines as well as the high-end Xeon processors.</p>
        <p>The name Pentium is originally derived from the Greek word <em>pente</em>, meaning "<em>five</em>" (as the original Pentium processors used Intel's fifth-generation micro-architecture, the <strong>P5</strong>), and the Latin ending <em>-ium</em>.</p>
