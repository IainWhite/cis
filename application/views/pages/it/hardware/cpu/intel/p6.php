        <p>The <strong>P6</strong> microarchitecture is the sixth generation <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel x86', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture, implemented by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium Pro', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessor that was introduced in November 1995. It is sometimes referred to as <strong>i686</strong>. It was succeeded by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NetBurst', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture in 2000, but eventually revived in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium M', 'CPU'); ?> line of microprocessors. The successor to the Pentium M variant of the P6 microarchitecture is the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture which in turn is also derived from the P6 microarchitecture.</p>
