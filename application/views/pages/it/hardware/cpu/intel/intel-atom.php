        <p><strong>Intel Atom</strong> is the brand name for a line of ultra-low-voltage IA-32 and x86-64 CPUs (or microprocessors) from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>, originally designed in 45 nm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) with subsequent models, codenamed Cedar, using a 32 nm process. Atom is mainly used in netbooks, nettops, embedded applications ranging from health care to advanced robotics, and mobile Internet devices (MIDs).</p>
        <p>Atom processors are based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bonnell', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture. On 21 December 2009, Intel announced the Pine Trail platform, including new Atom processor code-named <strong>Pineview</strong> (Atom N450), with total kit power consumption down 20%. On 28 December 2011, Intel updated the Atom line with the <strong>Cedar</strong> processors.</p>
