        <p>The <strong>Intel 8088</strong> microprocessor is a variant of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8086', 'CPU'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Introduced on 1 July 1979, the 8088 had an 8-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 8086.</p>
        <p>The 16-bit registers and the one megabyte address range were unchanged, however.</p>
        <p>In fact, according to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> documentation, the 8086 and 8088 have the same execution unit (EU) only the bus interface unit (BIU) is different.</p>
        <p>The original <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'ITH'); ?> was based on the 8088.</p>
