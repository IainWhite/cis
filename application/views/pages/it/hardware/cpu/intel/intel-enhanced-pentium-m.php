        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Intel Enhanced Pentium M'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Yonah CPU</strong> was launched in January 2006 under the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core', 'CPU'); ?> brand. Single and dual-core mobile version were sold under the Core Solo, Core Duo, and Pentium Dual-Core brands, and a server version was released as Xeon LV. These processors provided partial solutions to some of the foregoing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium M', 'CPU'); ?>'s shortcomings, by adding to its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('P6', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SSE3 Support</li>
            <li>Single- and dual-core technology with 2MB of shared L2 cache (restructuring processor organisation)</li>
            <li>Increased FSB speed, with the FSB running at 533 MT/s or 667 MT/s.</li>
            <li></li>A 12-stage instruction pipeline.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This resulted in the interim microarchitecture for low-voltage only CPUs, part way between P6 and the following Core microarchitecture.</p>
