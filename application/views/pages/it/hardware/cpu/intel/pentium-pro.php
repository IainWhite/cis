        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Intel Pentium Pro'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Pentium Pro</strong> is a sixth-generation <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86 microprocessor', 'CPU'); ?> developed and manufactured by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> introduced in 1 November 1995. It introduced the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('P6', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture (sometimes referred to as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('i686', 'CPU'); ?>) and was originally intended to replace the original <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium', 'CPU'); ?> in a full range of applications. While the Pentium and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium MXX', 'CPU'); ?> had 3.1 and 4.5 million transistors, respectively, the Pentium Pro contained 5.5 million transistors. Later, it was reduced to a more narrow role as a server and high-end desktop processor and was used in supercomputers like ASCI Red, the first computer to reach the teraFLOPS performance mark. The Pentium Pro was capable of both dual- and quad-processor configurations. It only came in one form factor, the relatively large rectangular Socket 8. The Pentium Pro was succeeded by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium II', 'CPU'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Xeon', 'CPU'); ?> in 1998.</p>
