        <p><strong>Core 2</strong> is a brand encompassing a range of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>'s consumer 64-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86-64', 'CPU'); ?> single, dual, and quad-core microprocessors based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture. The single and dual-core models are single-die, whereas the quad-core models comprise two dies, each containing two cores, packaged in a multi-chip module. The introduction of Core 2 relegated the [Pentium] brand to the mid-range market, and reunified laptop and desktop CPU lines, which previously had been divided into the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium 4', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium D', 'CPU'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium M', 'CPU'); ?> brands.</p>
        <p>The Core 2 brand was introduced on 27 July 2006, comprising the Solo (single-core), Duo (dual-core), Quad (quad-core), and in 2007, the Extreme (dual- or quad-core CPUs for enthusiasts) sub-brands. Intel Core 2 processors with vPro technology (designed for businesses) include the dual-core and quad-core branches.</p>
