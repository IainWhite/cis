        <p><strong>Intel Core i7</strong> as an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> brand name applies to several families of desktop and laptop 64-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86-64', 'CPU'); ?> processors using the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Nehalem', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Westmere', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sandy Bridge', 'CPU'); ?>, Ivy Bridge, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Haswell', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Broadwell', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Skylake', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitectures. The Core i7 brand targets the business and high-end consumer markets for both desktop and laptop computers, and is distinguished from the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core i3', 'CPU'); ?> (entry-level consumer), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core i5', 'CPU'); ?> (mainstream consumer), and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Xeon', 'CPU'); ?> (server and workstation) brands.</p>
        <p>Intel introduced the Core i7 name with the Nehalem based Bloomfield Quad-core processor in late 2008. In 2009 new Core i7 models based on the <strong>Lynnfield</strong> (Nehalem based) desktop quad-core processor and the Clarksfield (Nehalem based) quad-core mobile were added, and models based on the Arrandale dual-core mobile processor (also Nehalem based) were added in January 2010. The first six-core processor in the Core lineup is the Nehalem based <strong>Gulftown</strong>, which was launched on 16 March 2010. Both the regular Core i7 and the Extreme Edition are advertised as five stars in the Intel Processor Rating.</p>
        <p>In each of the first three microarchitecture generations of the brand, Core i7 has family members using two distinct system-level architectures, and therefore two distinct sockets (for example, LGA 1156 and LGA 1366 with Nehalem). In each generation, the highest-performing Core i7 processors use the same socket and QPI-based architecture as the medium-end <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Xeon', 'CPU'); ?> processors of that generation, while lower-performing Core i7 processors use the same socket and PCIe/DMI/FDI architecture as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core i5', 'CPU'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Core i7 is a successor to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel Core 2', 'CPU'); ?> brand. Intel representatives stated that they intend the moniker Core i7 to help consumers decide which processor to purchase as Intel releases newer Nehalem based products in the future.</p>
