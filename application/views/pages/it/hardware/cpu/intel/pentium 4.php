        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Intel Pentium 4'); ?>
        <p><strong>Pentium 4</strong> is a line of single-core desktop, laptop and entry level server central processing units (CPUs) introduced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> on 20 November 2000 and shipped through 8 August 2008. They had a seventh generation <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture, called <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NetBurst', 'CPU'); ?>, which was the company's first all-new design since the introduction of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('P6', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium Pro', 'CPU'); ?> CPUs in 1995. NetBurst differed from P6 (Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds. Intel claimed that NetBurst would allow clock speeds of up to 10 GHz in future chips; however, severe problems with heat dissipation (especially with the Prescott Pentium 4) limited CPU clock speeds to a much lower 3.8 GHz.</p>
        <p>In 2004, the initial 32-bit x86 instruction set of the Pentium 4 microprocessors was extended by the 64-bit x86-64 set.</p>
        <p>The first Pentium 4 cores, codenamed <em>Willamette</em>, were clocked from 1.3 GHz to 2 GHz. They were released on 20 November 2000, using the Socket 423 system. Notable with the introduction of the Pentium 4 was the 400 MT/s FSB. It actually operated at 100 MHz but the FSB was quad-pumped, meaning that the maximum transfer rate was four times the base clock of the bus, so it was marketed to run at 400 MHz. The AMD Athlon's double-pumped FSB was running at 100 or 133 MHz (200 or 266 MT/s) at that time.</p>
        <p>Pentium 4 CPUs introduced the SSE2 and, in the Prescott-based Pentium 4s, SSE3 instruction sets to accelerate calculations, transactions, media processing, 3D graphics, and games. Later versions featured Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT), a feature to make one physical CPU work as two logical CPUs. Intel also marketed a version of their low-end <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Celeron', 'CPU'); ?> processors based on the NetBurst microarchitecture (often referred to as Celeron 4), and a high-end derivative, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Xeon', 'CPU'); ?>, intended for multiprocessor servers and workstations. In 2005, the Pentium 4 was complemented by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium D', 'CPU'); ?> and Pentium Extreme Edition dual-core CPUs.</p>
