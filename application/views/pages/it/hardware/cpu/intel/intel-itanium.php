        <p><strong>Itanium</strong> is a family of 64-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> microprocessors that implement the Intel Itanium architecture (formerly called IA-64). Intel markets the processors for enterprise servers and high-performance computing systems. The Itanium architecture originated at Hewlett-Packard (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HP', 'C'); ?>), and was later jointly developed by HP and Intel.</p>
        <p>Itanium based systems have been produced by HP (the HP Integrity Servers line) and several other manufacturers. As of 2008, Itanium was the fourth most deployed microprocessor architecture for enterprise class systems, behind <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86-64', 'CPU'); ?>, Power Architecture, and SPARC.</p>
