        <p>The <strong>Intel 80386</strong> also known as the <strong>Intel386</strong>, <strong>i386</strong> was a 32-bit microprocessor introduced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> in 1985.</p>
        <p>The first versions had 275,000 transistors and were used as the central processing unit (CPU) of many workstations and high-end personal computers of the time.</p>
        <p>As the original implementation of the 32-bit extension of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8086', 'CPU'); ?> architecture, the 80386 instruction set, programming model, and binary encodings are still the common denominator for all 32-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> processors, this is termed x86, IA-32, or i386 architecture, depending on context.</p>
        <p>The 80386 could correctly execute most code intended for earlier 16-bit x86 processors such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8088', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('80286', 'CPU'); ?> that were ubiquitous in early PCs.</p>
        <p>Following the same tradition, modern 64-bit x86 processors are able to run most programs written for older chips, all the way back to the original 16-bit 8086 of 1978.</p>
        <p>Over the years, successively newer implementations of the same architecture have become several hundreds of times faster than the original 80386 (and thousands of times faster than the 8086).</p>
        <p>The 80386 was launched in October 1985, but full-function chips were first delivered in the third quarter of 1986.</p>
        <p>Mainboards for 80386-based computer systems were cumbersome and expensive at first, but manufacturing was rationalised upon the 80386's mainstream adoption.</p>
        <p>The first personal computer to make use of the 80386 was designed and manufactured by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Compaq', 'C'); ?> and marked the first time a fundamental component in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatible', 'ITH'); ?> de facto-standard was updated by a company other than <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>In May 2006, Intel announced that 80386 production would stop at the end of September 2007.</p>
        <p>Although it had long been obsolete as a personal computer CPU, Intel and others had continued making the chip for embedded systems.</p>
