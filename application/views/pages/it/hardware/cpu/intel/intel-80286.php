        <p>The <strong>Intel 80286</strong> introduced on 1 February 1982, is a 16-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessor with 134,000 transistors.</p>
        <p>Like its contemporary simpler cousin, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 80186', 'CPU'); ?>, it can correctly execute most software written for the earlier <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8086', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8088', 'CPU'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It was employed for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC AT', 'ITH'); ?>, introduced in 1984, and then widely used in most PC/AT compatible computers until the early 1990s.</p>
        <p>The 80286 was the first x86 microprocessor with memory management and wide protection abilities.</p>
