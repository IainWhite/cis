        <p>The <strong>Intel 8086</strong> is a 16-bit microprocessor chip designed by Intel between early 1976 and mid-1978, when it was released.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8088', 'CPU'); ?>, released in 1979, was a slightly modified chip with an external 8-bit data bus (allowing the use of cheaper and fewer supporting logic chips), and is notable as the processor used in the original <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The 8086 gave rise to the x86 architecture which eventually turned out as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>'s most successful line of processors.</p>
