        <p>The <strong>NetBurst</strong> microarchitecture, called <strong>P68</strong> inside <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>, was the successor to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('P6', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> family of CPUs made by Intel. The first CPU to use this architecture was the Willamette core <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium 4', 'CPU'); ?>, released on 20 November 2000 and the first of the Pentium 4 CPUs; all subsequent <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium 4', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium D', 'CPU'); ?> variants have also been based on NetBurst. In mid-2001, Intel released the <strong>Foster</strong> core, which was also based on NetBurst, thus switching the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Xeon', 'CPU'); ?> CPUs to the new architecture as well. Pentium 4 based <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Celeron', 'CPU'); ?> CPUs also use the NetBurst architecture.</p>
        <p>NetBurst was replaced with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture, released in July 2006.</p>
