        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Intel Core i5'); ?>
        <p>The first Core i5 using the Nehalem microarchitecture was introduced on 8 September 2009, as a mainstream variant of the earlier <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core i7', 'CPU'); ?>, the <strong>Lynnfield</strong> core. Lynnfield Core i5 processors have an 8MB L3 cache, a DMI bus running at 2.5 GT/s and support for dual-channel DDR3-800/1066/1333 memory and have Hyper-threading disabled. The same processors with different sets of features (Hyper-Threading and other clock frequencies) enabled are sold as Core i7-8xx and Xeon 3400-series processors, which should not be confused with high-end Core i7-9xx and Xeon 3500-series processors based on <strong>Bloomfield</strong>. A new feature called Turbo Boost Technology was introduced which maximizes speed for demanding applications, dynamically accelerating performance to match the workload.</p>
        <p>The Core i5-5xx mobile processors are named <strong>Arrandale</strong> and based on the 32 nm Westmere shrink of the Nehalem microarchitecture. Arrandale processors have integrated graphics capability but only two processor cores. They were released in January 2010, together with Core i7-6xx and Core i3-3xx processors based on the same chip. The L3 cache in Core i5-5xx processors is reduced to 3 MB, while the Core i5-6xx uses the full cache and the Core i3-3xx does not support for Turbo Boost. <strong>Clarkdale</strong>, the desktop version of Arrandale, is sold as Core i5-6xx, along with related Core i3 and Pentium brands. It has Hyper-Threading enabled and the full 4MB L3 cache.</p>
        <p>According to Intel "Core i5 desktop processors and desktop boards typically do not support ECC memory", but information on limited ECC support in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core i3', 'CPU'); ?> section also applies to Core i5 and i7.</p>
