        <p>The <strong>Pentium III</strong> brand refers to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>'s 32-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> desktop and mobile microprocessors based on the sixth-generation <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('P6', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture introduced on 26 February 1999. The brand's initial processors were very similar to the earlier <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium II', 'CPU'); ?> branded microprocessors. The most notable differences were the addition of the SSE instruction set (to accelerate floating point and parallel calculations), and the introduction of a controversial serial number embedded in the chip during the manufacturing process.</p>
