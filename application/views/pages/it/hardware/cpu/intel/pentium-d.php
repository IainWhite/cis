        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Intel Pentium D'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Pentium D</strong> brand refers to two series of desktop dual-core 64-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86-64', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessors with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NetBurst', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture, which is the dual-core variant of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium 4', 'CPU'); ?> "<em>Prescott</em>" manufactured by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>. Each CPU comprised two dies, each containing a single core, residing next to each other on a multi-chip module package. The brand's first processor, codenamed <em>Smithfield</em>, was released by Intel on 25 May 2005. Nine months later, Intel introduced its successor, codenamed <em>Presler</em>, but without offering significant upgrades in design, still resulting in relatively high power consumption. By 2004, the NetBurst processors reached a clock speed barrier at 3.8 GHz due to a thermal (and power) limit exemplified by the Presler's 130 watt thermal design power (a higher TDP requires additional cooling that can be prohibitively noisy or expensive). The future belonged to more energy efficient and slower clocked dual-core CPUs on a single die instead of two. The final shipment date of the dual die Presler chips was 8 August 2008, which marked the end of the Pentium D brand and also the NetBurst microarchitecture.</p>
