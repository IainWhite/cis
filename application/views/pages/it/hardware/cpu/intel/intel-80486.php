        <p>The <strong>Intel 80486</strong> (marketed as <strong>i486</strong>) was a higher performance follow-up to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 80386', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessor.</p>
        <p>Introduced in 1989, it was the first tightly pipelined <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> design as well as the first x86 chip to use more than a million transistors, due to a large on-chip cache and an integrated floating-point unit.</p>
        <p>It represents a fourth generation of binary compatible CPUs since the original <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8086', 'CPU'); ?> of 1978.</p>
        <p>The i486 was without the usual 80-prefix because of a court ruling that prohibited trademarking numbers (such as 80486).</p>
        <p>Later, with the introduction of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium', 'CPU'); ?> brand, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> began branding its chips with words rather than numbers.</p>
