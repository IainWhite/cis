        <p>The <strong>MOS Technology 6502</strong> is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by <strong>Chuck Peddle</strong> and <strong>Bill Mensch</strong> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MOS Technology', 'C'); ?>. When it was introduced in 1975, the 6502 was, by a considerable margin, the least expensive full-featured microprocessor on the market.</p>
        <p>It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>, and caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market.</p>
        <p>It was nevertheless fully comparable with them and, along with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Zilog Z80', 'CPU'); ?>, sparked a series of computer projects that would eventually result in the home computer revolution of the 1980s.</p>
        <p>Popular home video game consoles and computers, such as Atari, Apple II, Commodore 64 and others, used the 6502 or variations of the basic design.</p>
        <p>Soon after the 6502's introduction, MOS Technology was purchased outright by <strong>Commodore International</strong>, who continued to sell the microprocessor and licenses to other manufacturers.</p>
        <p>In the early days of the 6502, it was second-sourced by <strong>Rockwell</strong> and <strong>Synertek</strong>, and later licensed to other companies.</p>
