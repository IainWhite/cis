        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('ARM Architecture'); ?>
        <p><strong>ARM</strong> is a family of instruction set architectures for computer processors based on a <strong>Reduced Instruction Set Computing (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RISC', 'CPU'); ?>)</strong> architecture developed by British company <strong>ARM Holdings</strong>.</p>
        <p>A RISC-based computer design approach means ARM processors require significantly fewer transistors than typical <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CISC', 'CPU'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?>  processors in most personal computers.</p>
        <p>This approach reduces costs, heat and power use. These are desirable traits for light, portable, battery-powered devices including smartphones, laptops, tablet and notepad computers, and other embedded systems.</p>
        <p>A simpler design facilitates more efficient multi-core CPUs and higher core counts at lower cost, providing improved energy efficiency for servers.</p>

        <p>The British computer manufacturer <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn Computers', 'C'); ?>  first developed ARM in the 1980s to use in its personal computers.</p>
        <p>Its first ARM based products were coprocessor modules for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Micro', 'ITH'); ?>  series of computers.</p>
        <p>After the successful BBC Micro computer, Acorn Computers considered how to move on from the relatively simple <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MOS Technology 6502', 'CPU'); ?>  processor to address business markets like the one that was soon dominated by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'PC'); ?> , launched in 1981.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Acorn Business Computer (ABC)</strong> plan required that a number of second processors be made to work with the BBC Micro platform, but processors such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 68000', 'CPU'); ?>  and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('National Semiconductor 32016', 'CPU'); ?> were considered unsuitable, and the 6502 was not powerful enough for a graphics based user interface.</p>
