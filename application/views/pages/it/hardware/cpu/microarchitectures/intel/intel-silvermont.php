        <p><strong>Silvermont</strong> is a microarchitecture for low-power <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Atom', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Celeron', 'CPU'); ?> branded processors used in systems on a chip (SoCs) made by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>. Silvermont will form the basis for a total of four SoC families:
        <ul>
            <li>Merrifield and Moorefield  - consumer SoCs intended for smartphones</li>
            <li>Bay Trail - consumer SoCs aimed at tablets, hybrid devices, netbooks, nettops, and embedded / automotive systems</li>
            <li>Avoton - SoCs for micro-servers and storage devices</li>
            <li>Rangeley - SoCs targeting network and communication infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Silvermont was announced to news media on 6 May 2013 at Intel's headquarters at Santa Clara, California. Intel has repeatedly said the first Bay Trail devices will be available during the Holiday 2013 timeframe, while leaked slides show the most recent release window for Bay Trail-T as 28 August 2013. Both Avoton and Rangeley were announced as being available in the second half of 2013. The first Merrifield devices are expected in 1H14.</p>
