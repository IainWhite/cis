        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Intel Core Microarchitecture'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Intel Core</strong> microarchitecture (previously known as the Next-Generation Micro-Architecture) is a multi-core processor microarchitecture unveiled by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> in Q1 2006. It is based on the <strong>Yonah</strong> processor design and can be considered an iteration of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('P6', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture, introduced in 1995 with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium Pro', 'CPU'); ?>. The high power consumption and heat intensity, the resulting inability to effectively increase clock speed, and other shortcomings such as the inefficient pipeline were the primary reasons for which Intel abandoned the [NetBurst] microarchitecture and switched to completely different architectural design, delivering high efficiency through a small pipeline rather than high clock speeds. The Core microarchitecture never reached the clock speeds of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NetBurst', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture, even after moving to the 45 nm lithography.</p>
        <p>The first processors that used this architecture were code-named 'Merom', 'Conroe', and 'Woodcrest'; Merom is for mobile computing, Conroe is for desktop systems, and Woodcrest is for servers and workstations. While architecturally identical, the three processor lines differ in the socket used, bus speed, and power consumption. Mainstream Core based processors are branded Pentium Dual-Core or Pentium and low end branded <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Celeron', 'CPU'); ?>; server and workstation Core based processors are branded [Xeon]<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Xeon', 'CPU'); ?>, while desktop and mobile Core based processors are branded as Core 2. Despite their names, processors sold as Core Solo/Core Duo and Core i3/i5/i7 do not actually use the Core microarchitecture and are based on the Enhanced <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium M', 'CPU'); ?> and newer Nehalem/Sandy Bridge/Haswell microarchitectures, respectively.</p>
