        <p><strong>Nehalem</strrong> is the codename for an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> processor microarchitecture, which is the successor to the older <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture. A preview system with two Nehalem processors was shown at Intel Developer Forum in 2007, and the first processor released with the Nehalem architecture was the desktop <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Core i7', 'CPU'); ?>, which was released in November 2008.</p>
        <p>"Nehalem" is a recycled Intel codename and namesake of the Nehalem River. It is an architecture that differs radically from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Netburst', 'CPU'); ?>, while retaining some of the latter's minor features. Nehalem based microprocessors use the 45 nm process, run at higher clock speeds, and are more energy efficient than <strong>Penryn</strong> microprocessors. Hyper-threading is reintroduced, along with a reduction in L2 cache size, as well as an enlarged L3 cache that is shared among all cores.</p>
        <p>Nehalem was replaced with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sandy Bridge', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture, released in January 2011.</p>
