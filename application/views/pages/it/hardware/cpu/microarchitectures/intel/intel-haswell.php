        <p><strong>Haswell</strong> is the codename for a processor microarchitecture developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> as the successor to the <strong>Ivy Bridge</strong> microarchitecture. Intel officially announced CPUs based on this microarchitecture on 4 June 2013 at Computex Taipei 2013, while a working Haswell chip was demonstrated at the 2011 Intel Developer Forum. With Haswell, which uses a 22 nm process, Intel also introduced low-power processors designed for convertible or "hybrid" ultrabooks, designated by the "Y" suffix.</p>
        <p>Haswell CPUs are used in conjunction with the Intel 8 Series chipsets and Intel 9 Series chipsets.</p>
