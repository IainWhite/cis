        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('AMD Bulldozer Microarchitecture'); ?>
        <p><strong>Bulldozer</strong> is the codename for a microprocessor microarchitecture developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?> for the desktop and server markets. It was released on 12 October 2011 as the successor to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('K10', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture.</p>
        <p>Bulldozer is designed from scratch, not a development of earlier processors. The core is specifically aimed at computing products with TDPs of 10 to 125 watts. AMD claims dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores.</p>
        <p>The Bulldozer cores support most of the instruction sets implemented by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> processors available at its introduction (including SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AES, CLMUL, and AVX) as well as new instruction sets proposed by AMD; ABM, XOP, FMA4 and F16C.</p>
