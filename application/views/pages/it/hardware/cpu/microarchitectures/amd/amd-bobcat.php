        <p><strong>Bobcat</strong> is a microarchitecture created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?> aimed at low-power / low-cost market.</p>
        <p>It was revealed during a speech from AMD executive vice-president <strong>Henri Richard</strong> in Computex 2007 and was put into production Q1 2011. One of the major supporters was executive vice-president <strong>Mario A. Rivas</strong> who felt it was difficult to compete in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x*6', 'CPU'); ?> market with a single core optimised for the 10-100 Watts range and actively promoted the development of the simpler core with a target range of 1-10 Watts. In addition, it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand-held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than 1W.</p>
        <p>Bobcat cores are used together with GPU cores in accelerated processing units (APUs) under the "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Fusion', 'ITH'); ?>" brand. A simplified architecture diagram was released at AMD's Analyst Day in November 2009. This is similar in concept with earlier AMD research in 2003, detailing the specifications and advantages of extending x86 "everywhere".</p>
