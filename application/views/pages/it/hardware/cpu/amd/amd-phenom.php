        <p><strong>Phenom</strong> is the 64-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?> desktop processor line based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('K10', 'CPU'); ?> microarchitecture, in what AMD calls family 10h (10 hex, i.e. 16 in normal decimal numbers) processors, sometimes incorrectly called "K10h". Triple-core versions (codenamed <strong>Toliman</strong>) belong to the Phenom 8000 series and quad cores (codenamed <strong>Agena</strong>) to the AMD Phenom X4 9000 series. The first processor in the family was released in 2007.</p>
