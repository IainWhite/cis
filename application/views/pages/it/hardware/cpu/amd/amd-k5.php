        <p>The <strong>K5</strong> was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?>'s first <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> processor to be developed entirely in-house. Introduced in March 1996, its primary competition was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessor. The K5 was an ambitious design, closer to a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium Pro', 'CPU'); ?> than a Pentium regarding technical solutions and internal architecture. However, the final product was closer to the Pentium regarding performance, although faster clock for clock compared to the Pentium.</p>
