        <p>The <strong>Athlon 64</strong> is an eighth generation, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD64', 'CPU'); ?> architecture microprocessor produced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?>, released on 23 September 2003. It is the third processor to bear the name <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Athlon', 'CPU'); ?>, and the immediate successor to the Athlon XP. The second processor (after the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Opteron', 'CPU'); ?>) to implement AMD64 architecture and the first 64-bit processor targeted at the average consumer, it was AMD's primary consumer microprocessor, and competes primarily with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium 4', 'CPU'); ?>, especially the "<strong>Prescott</strong>" and "<strong>Cedar Mill</strong>" core revisions. It is AMD's first <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('K8', 'CPU'); ?>, eighth generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers. Despite being natively 64-bit, the AMD64 architecture is backward-compatible with 32-bit x86 instructions. Athlon 64s have been produced for Socket 754, Socket 939, Socket 940 and Socket AM2. The line was succeeded by the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon X2 lines.</p>
