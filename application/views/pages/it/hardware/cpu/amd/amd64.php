        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('AMD64 (x86-64)'); ?>
        <p><strong>x86-64</strong> (also known as <strong>x64</strong> and <strong>AMD64</strong>) is the 64-bit version of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86', 'CPU'); ?> instruction set. It supports vastly larger amounts (theoretically, 264 bytes or 16 exbibytes) of virtual memory and physical memory than is possible on its 32-bit predecessors, allowing programs to store larger amounts of data in memory. x86-64 also provides 64-bit general-purpose registers and numerous other enhancements. It is fully backward compatible with the 16-bit and 32-bit x86 code. Because the full x86 16-bit and 32-bit instruction sets remain implemented in hardware without any intervening emulation, existing x86 executables run with no compatibility or performance penalties, whereas existing applications that are recoded to take advantage of new features of the processor design may achieve performance improvements.</p>
        <p>The original specification was created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?>, and has been implemented by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VIA', 'C'); ?>. Various names are used for the instruction set; prior to the launch, x86-64 and x86_64 were used, while upon the release AMD named it AMD64. Intel initially used the names IA-32e and EM64T before finally settling on "Intel 64" for its implementation. Some in the industry, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>, use x86-64 and x86_64, while others, notably <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sun Microsystems', 'C'); ?> (now <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Oracle Corporation', 'C'); ?>) and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>, use x64 while the BSD family of OSs and several <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux distributions', 'OS'); ?> use AMD64.</p>
        <p>The AMD K8 processor was the first to implement the architecture; this was the first significant addition to the x86 architecture designed by a company other than Intel. Intel was forced to follow suit and introduced a modified [NetBurst] family which was fully software-compatible with AMD's design and specification. VIA Technologies introduced x86-64 in their VIA Isaiah architecture, with the VIA Nano.</p>
        <p>The x86-64 specification is distinct from the Intel Itanium (formerly IA-64) architecture, which is not compatible on the native instruction set level with the x86 architecture.</p>
