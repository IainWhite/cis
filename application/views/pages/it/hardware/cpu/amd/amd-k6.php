        <p>The <strong>K6</strong> microprocessor was launched by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?> in 1997. The main advantage of this particular microprocessor is that it was designed to fit into existing desktop designs for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pentium', 'CPU'); ?> branded CPUs. It was marketed as a product which could perform as well as its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel Pentium II', 'CPU'); ?> equivalent but at a significantly lower price. The K6 had a considerable impact on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC', 'ITH'); ?> market and presented <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> with serious competition.</p>
