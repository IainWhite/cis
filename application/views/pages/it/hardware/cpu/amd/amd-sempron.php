        <p><strong>Sempron</strong> has been the marketing name used by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?> for several different budget desktop CPUs, using several different technologies and CPU socket formats. The Sempron replaced the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD Duron', 'CPU'); ?> processor and competes against <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Celeron', 'CPU'); ?> series of processors. AMD coined the name from the Latin <em>semper</em>, which means "<em>always</em>", to suggest the Sempron is suitable for "<em>daily use, practical, and part of everyday life</em>".</p>
