        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('AMD Athlon'); ?>
        <p><strong>Athlon</strong> is the brand name applied to a series of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86 compatible', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessors designed and manufactured by <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?>). The original Athlon (now called <strong><em>Athlon Classic</em></strong>) was the first seventh generation x86 processor. The original Athlon was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz). AMD has continued using the Athlon name with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Athlon 64', 'CPU'); ?>, an eighth generation processor featuring <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x86-64', 'CPU'); ?> (later renamed AMD64) architecture, and the Athlon II.</p>
        <p>The Athlon made its debut on 23 June 1999. Athlon comes from the Greek <em>athlos</em> meaning "<em>contest</em>".</p>
