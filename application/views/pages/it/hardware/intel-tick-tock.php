        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Intel Tick-Tock'); ?>
        <p>"<strong>Tick-Tock</strong>" is a model adopted by chip manufacturer <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel Corporation', 'C'); ?> from 2007 to follow every <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('microarchitectural', 'CPU'); ?> change with a die shrink of the process technology. Every "tick" represents a shrinking of the process technology of the previous microarchitecture (sometimes introducing new instructions, as with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Broadwell', 'CPU'); ?>, released in late 2014) and every "tock" designates a new microarchitecture. Every year to 18 months, there is expected to be one tick or tock.</p>
