        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('DECmate'); ?>
        <p><strong>DECmate</strong> was the name of a series of PDP-8 compatible computers produced by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Equipment Corporation', 'C'); ?> in the late 1970s and early 1980s. All of the models used an <strong>Intersil 6100</strong> (later known as the <strong>Harris 6100</strong>) or Harris 6120 (an improved Intersil 6100) microprocessor which emulated the 12-bit DEC PDP-8 CPU. They were text-only and used the <strong>OS/78</strong> or <strong>OS/278</strong> operating systems, which were extensions of OS/8 for the PDP-8. Aimed for the word processing market, they typically ran the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WPS-8', 'ITS'); ?> word-processing program.</p>
        <p>Later models optionally had <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8088', 'CPU'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Z80', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessors which allowed them to run <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The range was a development of the VT78 which was introduced in July 1977.</p>
        <p>DECmate was introduced in 1980, this machine was built into a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VT100', 'VT'); ?> case. It had a 10MHz clock and 32 Kwords of memory. It was also known as the VT278.</p>

        <h2>DECmate II</h2>
        <p>As part of a three-pronged strategy against <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>, the company released this model at the same time as the PDP-11-based PRO-380 and the Intel 8088 based <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rainbow 100', 'VT'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The DECmate II resembles the Rainbow 100 but uses the 6120 processor. Its two operating systems are the WPS-8 word processing system, and the <strong>COS-310 Commercial Operating System</strong> running DIBOL. Like the others it had a monochrome VR201 (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VT220', 'VT'); ?> style) monitor, an LK201 keyboard and dual 400K single-sided quad-density 5.25 inch RX50 floppy disk drives. It had 32 Kwords of RAM for use by programs, and a further 32 Kwords containing code which was used for device emulation. Code running in this second bank was nicknamed "<em>slushware</em>", in contrast to firmware since it was loaded from floppy disk as the machine booted. It was also known as the PC278.</p>
        <p>It could be expanded, either by adding another pair of 5.25 inch floppy disk drives, and it could also support either an additional pair of RX01 or RX02 8-inch floppy disk drives or a winchester disk.</p>
        <p>It can also have a coprocessor board added, to allow it to run CP/M. There was a choice of three coprocessor boards, one with a Z80 and 64KB RAM, and a choice of two boards with both a Z80 and an Intel 8086, the difference being that they had either 256KB or 512KB RAM.</p>
        <p>Manufacture ceased in 1986. It was superseded by the DECmate III, introduced in 1984.</p>

        <h2>DECmate III</h2>
        <p>This was introduced in 1984. It had a smaller system case, color monitor, 8MHz clock, two 5.25-inch RX50 floppy disk drives, 32KB user RAM, 32KB system RAM. It was also known as the PC238.</p>

        <h2>DECmate III+</h2>
        <p>This was introduced in 1985 and withdrawn in 1990. It included a hard disk controller as part of the basic configuration. Otherwise, it was very similar to the DECmate III. It was also known as the PC24P.</p>
