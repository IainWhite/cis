        <p><strong>VAX</strong> was an instruction set architecture (ISA), developed by <strong>Digital Equipment Corporation (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC', 'C'); ?>)</strong> in the mid 1970s.</p>
        <p>The VAX-11/780, introduced on 25 October 1977, was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing that architecture.</p>
        <p>A 32-bit complex instruction set computer based on DEC's earlier PDP-11, VAX ("<strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>A</strong>ddress e<strong>X</strong>tension"), was designed to extend or replace DEC's various PDP ISAs.</p>
        <p>The VAX architecture's primary features were virtual addressing (for example demand paged virtual memory) and its orthogonal instruction set.</p>
        <p>VAX has been perceived as the quintessential CISC ISA, with its very large number of programmer-friendly addressing modes and machine instructions, highly orthogonal architecture, and instructions for complex operations such as queue insertion or deletion and polynomial evaluation.</p>
