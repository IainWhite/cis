        <p>The <strong>6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA)</strong> was an integrated circuit made by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MOS Technology', 'C'); ?>, as well as second sources including <strong>Rockwell</strong> and <strong>Synertek</strong>.</p>
        <p>It served as an I/O port controller for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('6502', 'CPU'); ?> family of microprocessors, providing the parallel I/O capabilities of the PIA as well as timers and a shift register for serial communications.</p>
        <p>The 6522 was very popular in computers of the 1980s, particularly Commodore's machines, and was also a central part of the designs of the Apple III, Oric-1 and Oric Atmos, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Microcomputer', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
