        <p>A <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong> (<strong>CPU</strong>) is the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('hardware', 'IT'); ?> within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.</p>
        <p>The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.</p>
        <p>The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.</p>
        <p>Example: Intel <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8086', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MOS 6502', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 68000', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Zilog Z80', 'CPU'); ?>.</p>
