        <p><strong>Apple TV</strong> is a digital media player and a microconsole developed and sold by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. It is a small network appliance and entertainment device that can receive digital data from a number of sources and stream it to a capable TV for playing on the TV screen.</p>
        <p>The third generation of Apple TV was introduced on 7 March 2012, incorporating the higher resolution (1080p) video standard. Apple TV is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HDMI', 'ITH'); ?> compliant source device connected to an enhanced definition or high definition widescreen television via a HDMI cable to the TV's HDMI port, and the TV is put into HDMI mode. The device has no integrated controls and can only be controlled externally, either by an Apple Remote control device (with which it is shipped) using its infrared capability or by the 'Remote' app (downloadable from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('App Store', 'MD'); ?>) on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> devices, such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?>, [<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPod Touch', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad', 'ITH'); ?>, or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Watch', 'ITH'); ?>, using its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi', 'ITN'); ?> capability. Its Wi-Fi capability is also used to receive digital content from the iTunes app using <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AirPlay', 'ITS'); ?> or directly from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iTunes Store', 'IT'); ?>, which is then streamed to the TV. It also plays digital content from the iTunes Store, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Now TV (UK only), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('YouTube', 'URL'); ?> and Vevo, along with the TV Everywhere portals of several cable and broadcast networks, and the video subscription portals of three of the four major North American sports leagues; MLB.tv, NBA League Pass and NHL GameCenter. It plays content from any <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> computer running iTunes.</p>
