        <p>The <strong>Macintosh</strong>, marketed as <strong>Mac</strong>, is a line of personal computers designed, developed, and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It was initially targeted mainly at the home, education, and creative professional markets. Since the introduction of the Macintosh, the computer has seen significant evolution, now making it one of the most powerful general purpose computers on the market.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Jobs', 'P'); ?> introduced the Macintosh 128K on 24 January 1984.</p>
        <p>This was the first mass market personal computer featuring a graphical user interface and mouse. The 128 was followed by numerous updated models also based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 68000', 'CPU'); ?> family processors, producing a family of products in the Macintosh line-up.</p>
        <p>Although the aggressively priced <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM Personal Computer', 'ITH'); ?> soon overtook Apple in sales, Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second largest PC manufacturer until 1994 when it was overtaken by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Compaq', 'C'); ?>.</p>
