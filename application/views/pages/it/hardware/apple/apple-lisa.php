        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Apple Lisa'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Lisa</strong> is a personal computer designed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Computer Inc', 'C'); ?> during the early 1980s. It was the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978. The Lisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.</p>
        <p></p>In 1982, after <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Jobs', 'P'); ?> was forced out of the Lisa project, he joined the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> project. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems. The final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.</p>
        <p>The Lisa was a more advanced system than the Macintosh of this time in many respects, such as its inclusion of protected memory, cooperative multitasking, a generally more sophisticated hard disk based operating system, a built-in screensaver, an advanced calculator with a paper tape and RPN, support for up to 2 megabytes (MB) of RAM, expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection schemes such as block sparing, non-physical file names (with the ability to have multiple documents with the same name), and a larger higher-resolution display. It would be many years before many of those features were implemented on the Macintosh platform. Protected memory, for instance, didn't reappear until the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X', 'OS'); ?> operating system was released in 2001. The Macintosh featured a faster <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('68000', 'CPU'); ?> processor (7.89 MHz) and sound, however, while the complexity of the Lisa operating system and its programs taxed the 5 MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessor so that consumers said it felt sluggish, particularly when scrolling in documents.</p>
