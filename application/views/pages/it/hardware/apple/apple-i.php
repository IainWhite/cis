        <p>The original <strong>Apple Computer 1</strong>, also known retroactively as the </strong>Apple I</strong>, or <strong>Apple-1</strong>, was released by the Apple Computer Company (now <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>) in 1976. They were designed and hand-built by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Wozniak', 'P'); ?>. Wozniak's friend <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Jobs', 'P'); ?> had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only means of transportation, a VW Microbus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the <strong>Homebrew Computer Club</strong> in Palo Alto, California.</p>
