        <p>The <strong>Apple IIe</strong> (styled as Apple //e, or sometimes Apple ][e) is the third model in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple II', 'ITH'); ?> series of personal computers produced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Computer', 'C'); ?>. The e in the name stands for enhanced, referring to the fact that several popular features were now built-in that were only available as upgrades and add-ons in earlier models. It also improved upon expandability and added a few new features, which, all combined, made it very attractive to first-time computer shoppers as a general-purpose machine. The Apple IIe has the distinction of being the longest-lived computer in Apple's history, having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes.</p>
