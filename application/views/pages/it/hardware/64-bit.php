        <p>In computer architecture, <strong>64-bit</strong> computing is the use of processors that have datapath widths, integer size, and memory address widths of 64 bits (eight octets). Also, 64-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. From the software perspective, 64-bit computing means the use of code with 64-bit virtual memory addresses.</p>
        <p>The term 64-bit describes a generation of computers in which 64-bit processors are the norm. 64 bits is a word size that defines certain classes of computer architecture, buses, memory and CPUs, and by extension the software that runs on them. 64-bit CPUs have been used in supercomputers since the 1970s (Cray-1, 1975) and in RISC-based workstations and servers since the early 1990s, notably the MIPS R4000, R8000, and R10000, the [DEC Alpha], the Sun UltraSPARC, and the IBM RS64 and POWER3 and later POWER microprocessors. In 2001 NEC released a 64 bit RISC CPU for mobile devices, notably the low cost Casio BE-300. In 2003 64-bit CPUs were introduced to the (previously 32-bit) mainstream personal computer arena in the form of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('x*6-64', 'CPU'); ?> and 64-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PowerPC', 'ITH'); ?> processor architectures and in 2012 even into the ARM architecture targeting smartphones and tablet computers, first sold on 20 September 2013 in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?> 5S powered by the ARMv8-A Apple A7 SoC.</p>
        <p></p>A 64-bit register can store 264 (over 18 quintillion or 1.8Ã—1019) different values. Hence, a processor with 64-bit memory addresses can directly access 264 bytes (=16 exbibytes) of byte-addressable memory.</p>
        <p>Without further qualification, a 64-bit computer architecture generally has integer and addressing registers that are 64 bits wide, allowing direct support for 64-bit data types and addresses. However, a CPU might have external data buses or address buses with different sizes from the registers, even larger (the 32-bit Pentium had a 64-bit data bus, for instance). The term may also refer to the size of low-level data types, such as 64-bit floating-point numbers.</p>
