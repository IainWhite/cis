        <p>The <strong>Atari</strong> 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Atari Inc', 'C'); ?> in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All are based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MOS Technology 6502', 'CPU'); ?> CPU running at 1.79 MHz, roughly twice that of similar designs, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple II', 'ITH'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore PET', 'ITH'); ?>, and gaming on the platform was a major draw; Star Raiders is widely considered the platform's killer app. Machines with similar performance would not appear until the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Micro', 'ITH'); ?> in late 1981 and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore 64', 'ITH'); ?> in 1982.</p>
        <p>The original Atari 400 and 800 models were released with a series of plug-n-play peripherals that used Atari's unique "SIO" serial bus system. Over the following decade several versions of the same basic design were released, including the XL and XE series of computers and matching peripherals. All of these used the same basic logical design, with various changes to the physical layout to lower production costs as chipmaking and manufacturing processes improved over time. The early machines were expensive to build, but dependable. Later models like the XEs were greatly cost-reduced and generally not as robust.</p>
        <p>The Atari 8-bit computer line sold two million units during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985, putting its sales on par with machines like the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sinclair ZX Spectrum', 'ITH'); ?> and TI-99/4A. Its primary competition in the worldwide market was, starting in 1982, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore 64', 'ITH'); ?>, which is by far the best selling computer of the 8-bit era. Atari also found a strong market in Eastern Europe and had something of a renaissance in the early 1990s as these countries joined a uniting Europe. Some estimates place sales during this period at another two million units.</p>
