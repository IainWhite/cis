        <p>The <strong>Atari ST</strong> is a line of home computers from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Atari Coporation', 'C'); ?>, and the successor to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Atari 8-bit family', 'ITH'); ?>. The first ST model, the 520ST, was released in June 1985. "<em>ST</em>" officially stands for "<em>Sixteen/Thirty-two</em>", which referred to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 68000', 'CPU'); ?>'s 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GEM', 'OS'); ?> released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration, and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than USD$1.</p>
        <p>The Atari ST is part of the 16/32 bit generation of home computers, based on the Motorola 68000 CPU, typically with 512KB of RAM or more, a graphical user interface, and 3Â½" microfloppy disks as storage. It was similar to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?>, and its simple design allowed the ST to precede the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore Amiga', 'ITH'); ?>'s commercial release by almost two months. The ST was primarily a competitor to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Amiga', 'ITH'); ?>, and in certain markets the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn Archimedes', 'ITH'); ?>. Where the Amiga has a graphics accelerator and sample-based synthesis based sound, the ST has a simple frame buffer and a 3 voice synthesizer chip, but with a slightly faster CPU and a high-resolution monochrome display mode ideal for business and CAD. In some markets, particularly Germany, the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and Desktop publishing work.</p>
        <p>Thanks to its built-in MIDI, the ST enjoyed success for running music-sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among both amateurs and well-known musicians.</p>
        <p>The ST was later superseded by the Atari STE, Atari TT, Atari MEGA STE and Falcon computers.</p>
