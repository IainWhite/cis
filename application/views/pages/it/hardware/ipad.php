        <p><strong>iPad</strong> is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. The first iPad was released on 3 April 2010. The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPad includes built-in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi', 'ITN'); ?> and cellular connectivity on select models. As of January 2015, there have been over 250 million iPads sold.</p>
        <p>An iPad can shoot video, take photos, play music, and perform Internet functions such as Web browsing and emailing. Other functions games, reference, GPS navigation, social networking, etc. can be enabled by downloading and installing apps. As of October 2013, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('App Store', 'MD'); ?> has more than 475,000 native apps by Apple and third parties.</p>
        <p>There have been six versions of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, such as the 9.7-inch screen size and button placement, that have persisted through all models. The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad 2', 'ITH'); ?> introduced a whole new design which also added a dual core Apple A5 processor and VGA front facing and 720p rear facing cameras designed for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FaceTime', 'ITS'); ?> video calling, and dramatically reduced the thickness of the device. The third generation added a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Retina Display', 'ITH'); ?>, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5 megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaces the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad Air', 'ITH'); ?> added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness for the first time since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, a 8 megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and further reduced the thickness.</p>
        <p>There have been three versions of the iPad Mini. The first generation features a reduced screen size of 7.9 inches and features similar internal specifications as the iPad 2 except it uses the Lightning connector. The iPad Mini 2 features the Retina Display, the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, closely matching the internals specifications of the iPad Air. The iPad Mini 3 features the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.</p>
