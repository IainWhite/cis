        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('8-bit'); ?>
        <p>In computer architecture, <strong>8-bit</strong> integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are at most 8 bits (1 <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('octet', 'IT'); ?>) wide. Also, 8-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 8-bit is also a term given to a generation of microcomputers in which 8-bit microprocessors were the norm.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM System/360', 'ITH'); ?> introduced byte addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit addressable or decimal digit addressable or word addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.</p>
        <p>The first widely adopted 8-bit microprocessor was the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8080', 'CPU'); ?>, being used in many hobbyist computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, often running the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?> operating system; it had 8-bit data words and 16-bit addresses. The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Zilog Z80', 'CPU'); ?> (compatible with the 8080) and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 6800', 'CPU'); ?> were also used in similar computers. The Z80 and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MOS technology 6502', 'CPU'); ?> 8-bit CPUs were widely used in home computers and second and third generation game consoles of the '70s and '80s. Many 8-bit CPUs or microcontrollers are the basis of today's ubiquitous embedded systems.</p>
