        <p>The <strong>Acorn Atom</strong> was a home computer made by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn', 'C'); ?> Computers Ltd from 1980 to 1982 when it was replaced by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Micro', 'ITH'); ?> (originally called the <em>Proton</em>).</p>
        <p>The Atom was a progression of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MOS Technology 6502', 'CPU'); ?> based machines that the company had been making from 1979.</p>
        <p>The Atom was a cut-down Acorn System 3 without a disk drive but with an integral keyboard and cassette tape interface, sold in either kit or complete form.</p>
        <p>The minimum Atom had 2k of RAM and 8k of ROM, with a fully loaded machine having 12k of each.</p>
        <p>An additional floating point ROM was also available.</p>
        <p>The 12k of RAM was divided between 5k available for programs, 1k for the page zero and 6k for the high resolution graphics.</p>
        <p>The bottom kilobyte of memory was used by the CPU for stack storage, by the OS, and by the Atom BASIC for variable storage of the 27 variables.</p>
