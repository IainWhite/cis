        <p>The <strong>Sinclair QL</strong> (for Quantum leap), is a personal computer launched by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sinclair Research', 'C'); ?> in 1984, as an upper-end counterpart to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sinclair ZX Spectrum', 'ITH'); ?>. The QL was aimed at the serious home user and professional and executive users markets from small to large businesses and higher educational establishments, but failed to achieve commercial success.</p>
