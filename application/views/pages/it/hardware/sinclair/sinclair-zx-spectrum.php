        <p>The <strong>ZX Spectrum</strong> is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sinclair Research Ltd', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Referred to during development as the <strong>ZX81 Colour</strong> and <strong>ZX82</strong>, the machine was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair to highlight the machine's colour display, compared with the black and white of its predecessor, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Z81', 'ITH'); ?>. The Spectrum was ultimately released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level model with 16KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987; together they sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide (not counting numerous clones).</p>
        <p>The Spectrum was among the first mainstream audience home computers in the UK, similar in significance to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore 64', 'ITH'); ?> in the USA. The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine, the effects of which are still seen; some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry. Licensing deals and clones followed, and earned <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Clive Sinclair', 'P'); ?> a knighthood for "services to British industry".</p>
        <p>The Commodore 64, Oric-1 and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Atmos', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Microcomputer', 'ITH'); ?> and later the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Amstrad CPC', 'ITH'); ?> range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s. Over 24,000 software titles have been released since the Spectrum's launch and new titles continue to be released over 100 in 2012.</p>
