        <p>The <strong>Sinclair ZX80</strong> is a home computer brought to market in 1980 by <strong>Science of Cambridge Ltd</strong>. (later to be better known as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sinclair Research', 'C'); ?>). It is notable for being the first computer (unless one counts the MK14) available in the United Kingdom for less than a hundred pounds. It was available in kit form for 79.95GBP, where purchasers had to assemble and solder it together, and as a ready built version at 99.95GBP. The ZX80 was very popular straight away, and for some time there was a waiting list of several months for either version of the machine.</p>
        <p>The ZX80 was named after the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Z80', 'CPU'); ?> processor with the '<em>X</em>' for "<em>the mystery ingredient</em>".</p>
