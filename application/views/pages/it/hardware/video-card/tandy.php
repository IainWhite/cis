        <p><strong>Tandy Graphics Adapter (TGA)</strong> is a computer display standard for an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'PC'); ?> compatible video adapter that improved on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>'s <strong>Color Graphics Adapter (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CGA', 'VID'); ?>)</strong> technology. Whereas CGA could display only four colours at a time at a screen resolution of 320x200 pixels, a TGA adapter could display up to 16 colours.</p>
        <p>IBM premiered the new video adapter in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PCjr', 'PC'); ?> home computer it announced in 1983. At that time, the company called the adapter the <strong>Video Gate Array</strong> (not to be confused with the later <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Video Graphics Array', 'VID'); ?> standard), or <strong>CGA Plus</strong>. The adapter incorporated the <strong>Motorola 6845</strong>, an integrated circuit for controlling video.</p>
        <p>The PCjr was not popular, but the <strong>Tandy 1000</strong> family of home computers were compatible with its video standard and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Texas Instruments', 'C'); ?> SN76489 based enhanced sound, and sold well. With built-in joystick ports the 1000 was the best platform for IBM PC compatible games before the VGA era, and the combination of its graphics and sound became known as "Tandy compatible"; 28 of 66 games that Computer Gaming World tested in 1989 supported Tandy graphics. The later Tandy 1000 SL and TL models were equipped with an enhanced version of the CGA Plus adapter, capable of displaying 16 colours at an improved resolution of 640x200.</p>
