        <p><strong>Professional Graphics Controller</strong> (<strong>PGC</strong>, often called <strong>Professional Graphics Adapter</strong> and sometimes <strong>Professional Graphics Array</strong>) was a graphics card manufactured by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PCs', 'PC'); ?>. It consisted of three interconnected PCBs, and contained its own processor and memory. The PGC was, at the time of its release, the most advanced graphics card for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM XT', 'PC'); ?> and aimed for tasks such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CAD', 'ITS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Introduced in 1984, the Professional Graphics Controller offered a maximum resolution of 640x480 with 256 colours at a refresh rate of 60 Hertz a higher resolution and colour depth than <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('EGA', 'VID'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VGA', 'VID'); ?> supported. This mode is not <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BIOS', 'IT'); ?> supported. It was intended for the Computer Aided Design market and included 320kB of display RAM and an on-board [Intel 8088] microprocessor. The 8088 was placed directly on the card to permit rapid updates of video memory. Other cards forced the PC's CPU to write to video memory through a slower <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ISA', 'ITH'); ?> bus. While never widespread in consumer class personal computers, its US$4,290 list price compared favourably to US$50,000 dedicated CAD workstations of the time. It was discontinued in 1987 with the arrival of VGA and 8514.</p>
