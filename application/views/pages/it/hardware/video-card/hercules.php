        <p>The <strong>Hercules Graphics Card (HGC)</strong> was a computer graphics controller made by <strong>Hercules Computer Technology Inc</strong> that combined <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>'s text-only <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MDA', 'VID'); ?> display standard with a bitmapped graphics mode. This allowed the HGC to offer both high quality text and graphics from a single card. The HGC was very popular, and became a widely supported de facto display standard on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatibles', 'PC'); ?> connected to a monochrome monitor. The HGC standard was used long after more technically capable systems had entered the market, especially on dual-monitor setups.</p>
