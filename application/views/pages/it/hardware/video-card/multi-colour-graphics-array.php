        <p>The <strong>Multi Colour Graphics Array</strong> or <strong>MCGA</strong> was a video subsystem built into the motherboard of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PS/2', 'PC'); ?> Model 30, introduced on 2 April 1987, and Model 25, introduced later on 11 August no standalone MCGA cards were ever made.</p>
        <p>The MCGA supported all <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CGA', 'VID'); ?> display modes plus 640x480 monochrome at a refresh rate of 60Hz, and 320x200 with 256 colours (out of a palette of 262,144) at 70Hz. The display adapter used a DE-15 connector. The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MDA', 'VID'); ?> monochrome text mode was not supported.</p>
        <p>MCGA was similar to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VGA', 'VID'); ?> in that it had a 256-colour mode (the 256-colour mode in VGA was sometimes referred to as MCGA) and used 15-pin analog connectors. The PS/2 chipset's limited abilities prevented <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('EGA', 'VID'); ?> compatibility and high-resolution multi-color VGA display modes.</p>
        <p>The tenure of MCGA was brief; the PS/2 Model 25 and Model 30 were discontinued by 1992, and no manufacturer produced a clone of this display adapter except for <strong>Epson Equity Ie</strong>, since the VGA standard introduced at the same time was considered superior.</p>
