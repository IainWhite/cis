        <p><strong>Video Graphics Array (VGA)</strong> refers specifically to the display hardware first introduced with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PS/2', 'PC'); ?> line of computers in 1987, but through its widespread adoption has also come to mean either an <strong>Amplitude Modulated</strong> computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector or the 640x480 resolution itself.</p>
        <p>VGA was the last <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> graphics standard to which the majority of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC clone', 'PC'); ?> manufacturers conformed, making it the lowest common denominator that virtually all post 1990 PC graphics hardware can be expected to implement. It was officially followed by IBM's <strong>Extended Graphics Array (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XGA', 'VID'); ?>)</strong> standard, but was effectively superseded by numerous slightly different extensions to VGA made by clone manufacturers, collectively known as <strong>Super VGA</strong>.</p>
        <p>Today, the VGA analog interface is used for high definition video, including resolutions of 1080p and higher. While the transmission bandwidth of VGA is high enough to support even higher resolution playback, there can be picture quality degradation depending on cable quality and length. How discernible this degradation is depends on the individual's eyesight and the display, though it is more noticeable when switching to and from digital inputs like <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HDMI', 'ITH'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DVI', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
