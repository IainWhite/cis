        <p>The <strong>iPhone 3G</strong> is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. It is the second generation of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?>, and was introduced on 9 June 2008, at the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WWDC', 'IT'); ?> 2008 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, United States.</p>
        <p>The iPhone 3G is internally similar to its predecessor, but includes several new hardware features, such as GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. The device was originally loaded with the concurrently launched <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone OS 2.0', 'OS'); ?>. In addition to other features (including push email and turn-by-turn navigation), this new operating system introduced the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('App Store', 'MD'); ?> Apple's new distribution platform for third-party applications.</p>
