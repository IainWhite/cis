        <p><strong>Phone 5S</strong> is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> smartphone designed and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. Apple held an event to formally introduce the high-range phone and its mid-range counterpart, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5C', 'ITH'); ?>, on 10 September 2013, and they were released on 20 September 2013.</p>
        <p>As with the naming precedents of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 3GS', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 4S', 'ITH'); ?>, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5S', 'ITH'); ?> is a revised version of its predecessor, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5', 'ITH'); ?>. The phone maintains a very similar design to its predecessor, aside from the introduction of a new home button design using a laser-cut sapphire cover surrounded by a metallic ring, Touch ID, a fingerprint recognition system built directly into the home button which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('App Store', 'MD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iTunes Store', 'IT'); ?> purchases, and an updated camera with a larger aperture and a dual-LED flash optimised for different colour temperatures. It also introduced the A7 dual-core processor, the first 64-bit (ARMv8-A) processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the M7 "motion co-processor", a dedicated processor for processing motion data from its accelerometer and gyroscopes without requiring the attention of the main processor. It was also the first Apple device to ship with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS 7', 'OS'); ?>, which introduced a revamped visual appearance and other new features.</p>
        <p>Reception towards the device was generally positive, with some outlets considering it to be best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7. However, others criticised iPhone 5S for being too similar to its predecessors, while others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system. Nine million units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones. The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013.</p>
        <p>On 19 September 2014, the iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship cellphone by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 6', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 6 Plus', 'ITH'); ?>, but the older model remains available for purchase at a reduced price.</p>
