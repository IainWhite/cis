        <p>The <strong>iPhone 5</strong> is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. It is the sixth generation of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?>, succeeding the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 4S', 'ITH'); ?> and preceding the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5S', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5C', 'ITH'); ?>. Formally unveiled as part of a press event on 12 September 2012, it was released on 21 September 2012. The iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller screen with a nearly 16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector which replaces the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second Apple phone to include its new [Sony] made 8MP Camera, first introduced on the iPhone 4S.</p>
        <p>Apple began taking pre-orders on 14 September 2012, and over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on 21 September 2012, and was described by Apple as "extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. While reception to the iPhone 5 was generally positive, consumers and reviewers noted hardware issues, such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken, and the phone's coating being prone to chipping. Reception was also mixed over Apple's decision to switch to a different dock connector design, as the change affected iPhone 5's compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible with previous iterations of the line.</p>
        <p>The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on 10 September 2013 with the announcement of its successor, iPhone 5S, and iPhone 5C, the latter being a lower cost variation of the iPhone 5 with similar internal hardware and plastic casing. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.</p>
        <p>On 28 April 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost. On 23 August 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.</p>
