        <p>The <strong>iPhone 4S</strong> (retroactively stylised with a lowercase 's' as <strong>iPhone 4s</strong> as of September 2013) is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. It is the fifth generation of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?>, succeeding the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 4', 'ITH'); ?> and preceding the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5', 'ITH'); ?>. Announced on 4 October 2011 at Apple's Cupertino campus, its media coverage was accompanied by the death of former Apple CEO and co-founder <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Jobs', 'P'); ?> on the following day.</p>
        <p>Available for pre-order on 7 October and coming to mainstream availability in retail stores on 14 October in the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan, sales peaked over its predecessor with over a million sales in the first twenty four hours of preorder availability and over four million sales in the first four days of retail availability. Further worldwide rollout, including 22 additional countries on 28 October came over the next several months.</p>
        <p>This iPhone was named "4S" where "S" stood for Siri (Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that during the Q&amp;A session at the D10 conference in May 2012), an iPhone 4S exclusive intelligent personal assistant that was later included in future generations of mobile Apple products. Retaining the external design of the iPhone 4, the 4S hosted revised hardware specifications, most notably an upgrade to the Apple A5 chipset, and an 8-megapixel camera with 1080p video recording. It debuted with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS 5', 'ITH'); ?>, the fifth major version of iOS, Apple's mobile operating system, that introduced features including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iCloud', 'URL'); ?>, iMessage, Notification Center, Reminders, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Twitter', 'URL'); ?> integration.</p>
        <p>Reception to the iPhone 4S was generally favorable. Reviewers noted <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Siri', 'IT'); ?>, the new camera, and processing speeds as significant advantages over the prior model. It was succeeded by the iPhone 5 as Apple's flagship phone on 12 September 2012. The iPhone 4S remained in production, albeit being sold with reduced storage (from 16/32/64 GB down to 8 GB.) It was officially discontinued on 9 September 2014 following the announcement of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 6', 'ITH'); ?> but is currently supported as of [iOS 9]: so the iPhone 4S is the first iPhone to support five major versions of iOS: these being iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.</p>
