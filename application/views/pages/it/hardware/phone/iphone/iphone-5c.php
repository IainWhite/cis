        <p>The <strong>iPhone 5C</strong> (marketed with a stylised lowercase 'c' as <strong>iPhone 5c</strong>) is a smartphone designed and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. It is one of two successors to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5', 'ITH'); ?> and one of two predecessors to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 6', 'ITH'); ?>, along with its higher-end counterpart, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 5S', 'ITH'); ?>. Apple held an event to formally introduce the iPhone 5C and 5S on 10 September 2013, and they were released on 20 September 2013, therefore discontinuing sales of the previous iPhone 5.</p>
        <p>The 5C originally shipped with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS 7', 'OS'); ?>, Apple's mobile operating system. The current version of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> for the iPhone 5C is <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS 8.4', 'OS'); ?>. The 5C uses much of the same hardware as the iPhone 5, with some iOS 7 optimisation like slightly improved battery life and software hardware colour coherence. However, there are a few differences from the iPhone 5; the 5C uses a hard-coated polycarbonate casing instead of aluminum used by the 5, along with a standard black glass front (instead of a white glass front offered on silver and gold iPhone models). The 5C lacks some of the features from the 5S; it uses the A6 chip instead of the A7 with motion co-processor, does not include Touch ID, does not support OpenGL ES 3.0, and lacked the Burst iSight camera mode and slow-motion video recording mode until [iOS 8]. Similar to the fifth generation [iPod Touch] models, the iPhone 5C is available in five colours: blue, green, pink, yellow, and white.</p>
        <p>On 9 September 2014, the 16 and 32GB iPhone 5C models were discontinued in unison with the announcement of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 6', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 6 Plus', 'ITH'); ?>, and the 16 and 32GB models were replaced by the 8GB model.</p>
