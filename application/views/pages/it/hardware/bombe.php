        <p>The <strong>Bombe</strong> was an electromechanical device used by British cryptologists to help decipher German <strong>Enigma</strong> machine encrypted secret messages during World War II.</p>
        <p>The initial design of the Bombe was produced in 1939 at the <strong>UK Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)</strong> at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bletchley Park', 'C'); ?> by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Alan turing', 'P'); ?>, with an important refinement devised in 1940 by <strong>Gordon Welchman</strong>.</p>
        <p>The engineering design and construction was the work of <strong>Harold Keen</strong> of the British Tabulating Machine Company.</p>
        <p>It was a substantial development from a device that had been designed in 1938 by <strong>Polish Cipher Bureau</strong> cryptologist <strong>Marian Rejewski</strong>, and known as the "<em>cryptologic bomb</em>" (Polish: <em>bomba kryptologiczna</em>).</p>
        <p>The Bombe was designed to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military networks: specifically, the set of rotors in use and their positions in the machine; the rotor core start positions for the message—the message key—and one of the wirings of the plugboard.</p>
