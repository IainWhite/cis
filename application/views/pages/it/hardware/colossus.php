        <p><strong>Colossus</strong> was the world's first electronic digital computer that was at all programmable.</p>
        <p>The Colossus computers were developed for British codebreakers during World War II to help in the cryptanalysis of the <strong>Lorenz cipher</strong>.</p>
        <p>Without them, the Allies would have been deprived of the very valuable military intelligence that was obtained from reading the vast quantity of encrypted high-level telegraphic messages between the German High Command and their army commands throughout occupied Europe.</p>
        <p>Colossus used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) to perform Boolean operations and calculations.</p>
        <p>Colossus was designed by the engineer <strong>Tommy Flowers</strong> to solve a problem posed by mathematician <strong>Max Newman</strong> at the <strong>Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)</strong> at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bletchley Park', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Alan Turing', 'P'); ?>'s use of probability in cryptanalysis contributed to its design.</p>
        <p>It has sometimes been erroneously stated that Turing designed Colossus to aid the Cryptanalysis of the Enigma. Turing's machine that helped decode Enigma was the electromechanical <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bombe', 'ITH'); ?>, not Colossus.</p>
        <p>The prototype, Colossus Mark 1, was shown to be working in December 1943 and was operational at Bletchley Park by 5 February 1944.</p>
        <p>An improved Colossus Mark 2 that used shift registers to quintuple the speed, first worked on 1 June 1944, just in time for the Normandy Landings.</p>
        <p>Ten Colossi were in use by the end of the war.</p>
        <p>The destruction of most of the Colossus hardware and blueprints, as part of the effort to maintain a project secrecy that was kept up into the 1970s, deprived most of those involved with Colossus of credit for their pioneering advancements in electronic digital computing during their lifetimes.</p>
        <p>A functioning replica of a Colossus computer was completed in 2007 and is on display at the The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park.</p>
