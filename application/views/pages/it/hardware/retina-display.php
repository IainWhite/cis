        <p><strong>Retina Display</strong> is a brand name used by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?> for screens that have a higher pixel density than their previous models. The terms are used for several Apple products, including the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPod Touch', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MacBook', 'ITH'); ?> (2015 version), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MacBook Pro', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad Mini', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad Air', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iMac', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The goal of retina displays is to allow the extremely crisp display of text and images, allowing computer screens to rival the smooth curves and sharpness of printed text and immediacy of photographic prints, while avoiding previous compromises such as specially designed fonts designed to render well on screen.</p>
        <p>Because the typical viewing distance is different, depending on each device's use, the pixels per inch claiming to be of Retina quality can differ, depending on the size of the display, with higher PPI for smaller displays and lower PPI for larger displays. Later device versions have an even higher quality improvement, either counted by an increase in the PPI (the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone 6 Plus', 'ITH'); ?>) and / or by an increase in the number of pixels (the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and iMac With Retina 5K Display), thus Apple using the name "<strong>Retina HD Display</strong>" or "<strong>Retina 5K Display</strong>".</p>
        <p>When an Apple product has a Retina Display, each user interface widget is doubled in width and height to compensate for the smaller pixels. Apple calls this mode <strong>HiDPI</strong> mode. Apple has applied to register the term "<em>Retina</em>" as a trademark in regard to computers and mobile devices with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Canadian Intellectual Property Office, and in Jamaica. On 27 November 2012 the US Patent and Trademark office approved Apple's application and "Retina" is now a registered trademark for computer equipment.</p>
