        <p>The <strong>Dragon 32</strong> and <strong>Dragon 64</strong> are home computers that were built in the 1980s. The Dragons are very similar to the <strong>TRS-80 Color Computer</strong>, and were produced for the European market by <strong>Dragon Data Ltd</strong>, in Port Talbot, Wales, and for the US market by <strong>Tano</strong> of New Orleans, Louisiana. The model numbers reflect the primary difference between the two machines, which have 32 and 64 kilobytes of RAM, respectively.</p>
