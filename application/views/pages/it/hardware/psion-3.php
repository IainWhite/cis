        <p>The <strong>Psion Series 3</strong> range of personal digital assistants were made by Psion PLC.</p>
        <p>The four main variants are the <strong>Psion Series 3</strong> (1991), the <strong>Psion Series 3a</strong> (1993), the <strong>Psion Series 3c</strong> (1996), and the <strong>Psion Series 3mx</strong> (1998), all sized 165x85x22mm.</p>
        <p>The Psion Series 3 was the first truly useful Personal Digital Assistant or PDA.</p>
        <p>Its purpose was to replace the old-fashioned paper agenda and Rolodex, but it could do much more.</p>
        <p>Besides the agenda with multiple views, it featured a database, a word processor, a spreadsheet with charts, world times and more.</p>
        <p>With an optional modem, it could connect to the Internet.</p>
        <p>It could be programmed in <strong>OPL (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Organiser Programming Language', 'OS'); ?>)</strong>, with easy access to menu and graphical functions.</p>
