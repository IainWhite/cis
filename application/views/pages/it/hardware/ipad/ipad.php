        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('First Generation iPad'); ?>
        <p>The first generation <strong>iPad</strong> is a tablet computer designed and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. The device features an Apple A4 processor, a 9.7" touchscreen display and the capability of accessing Cellular networks, though the latter is only available on certain variants of the first generation iPad. Using the [iOS] operating system, the iPad can play music, send and receive email and browse the web. Other functions, which include the ability to play games and access references, GPS navigation software and social network services can be enabled by downloading apps.</p>
        <p>The device was announced and unveiled on 27 January 2010 at a media conference. On 4 April 2010, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi', 'ITN'); ?> variant of the device was released in the United States, followed by the release of the Wi-Fi + Cellular variant on 30 April. On 28 May, it was released in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>The device received primarily positive reviews from various technology blogs and publications. Reviewers praised the device for its wide range of capabilities and labelled it as a competitor to laptops and netbooks. Some aspects were criticised, including the closed nature of the operating system and the lack of support for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Flash', 'ITS'); ?> multimedia format. During the first 80 days, three million iPads were sold. By the launch of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad 2', 'ITH'); ?>, Apple sold more than 15 million iPads.</p>
        <p>On 2 March 2011, Apple announced the new iPad 2 and the discontinuation of production of the original iPad.</p>
