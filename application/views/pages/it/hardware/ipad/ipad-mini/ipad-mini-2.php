        <p>The <strong>iPad Mini 2</strong> is the second generation <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad Mini', 'ITH'); ?> tablet computer produced and marketed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>. It has a design almost identical to that of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('first generation iPad Mini', 'ITH'); ?> but features internal revisions such as the addition of the A7 system-on-a-chip and 2,048 x 1,536 resolution <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Retina Display', 'ITH'); ?>. Internally, the iPad Mini 2 has nearly the same hardware as its sibling device, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad Air', 'ITH'); ?>. Apple quietly released the iPad Mini 2 in Space Gray and Silver colours on 12 November 2013.</p>
        <p>Its successor, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad Mini 3', 'ITH'); ?>, was unveiled on 16 October 2014.</p>
