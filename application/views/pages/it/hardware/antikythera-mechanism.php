        <p>The <strong>Antikythera mechanism</strong> is an ancient analogue computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses.</p>
        <p>It was recovered in 1900-01 from the Antikythera wreck, a shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera.</p>
        <p>The computer's construction has been attributed to the Greeks and dated to the early 1st century BC.</p>
        <p>Technological artefacts approaching its complexity and workmanship did not appear again until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks began to be built in Western Europe.</p>
        <p>The mechanism was housed in a wooden box about 340x180x90 mm in size and comprised 30 bronze gears (although more could have been lost). The largest gear was about 140mm in diameter and had 223 teeth.</p>
        <p>The mechanism's remains were found as 82 separate fragments of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.</p>
        <p>Today, the fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are kept at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.</p>
