        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('32-bit'); ?>
        <p>In computer architecture, <strong>32-bit</strong> integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are at most 32 bits (4 <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('octets', 'IT'); ?>) wide. Also, 32-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 32-bit is also a term given to a generation of microcomputers in which 32-bit microprocessors are the norm.</p>
        <p></p>A 32-bit register can store 232 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 32 bits is -2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647 (unsigned: 0 through 4,294,967,295). Hence, a processor with 32-bit memory addresses can directly access 4GB of byte addressable memory.</p>
