        <p><strong>Google Nexus</strong> is a line of consumer electronic devices that run the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> operating system. Google manages the design, development, marketing, and support of these devices, but some development and all manufacturing are carried out by partnering original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The product family consists mostly of mobile devices six smartphones and four tablet computers have been released to date. As of April 2015, the devices currently available in the line are the Nexus 6 smartphone (made with Motorola Mobility), Nexus 9 tablet (made with HTC), and Nexus Player digital media player (made with Asus).</p>
        <p>Devices in the Nexus line are considered Google's flagship Android products. They contain little to no manufacturer or wireless carrier modifications to Android (such as custom graphical user interfaces), although devices sold through carriers are sometimes SIM locked and may bear some extra branding. Nexus 6 devices sold through AT&amp;T, for example, are SIM locked and feature a custom boot splash screen and a logo on the back of the device, despite having otherwise identical hardware to the unlocked variant. The Verizon Galaxy Nexus featured a Verizon logo on the back and received software updates at a slower pace than the unlocked variant, though it featured different hardware to accommodate Verizon's CDMA network. All Nexus devices feature an unlock-able boot-loader to allow further development and end user modification. Nexus devices are often among the first Android devices to receive updates to the operating system.</p>
