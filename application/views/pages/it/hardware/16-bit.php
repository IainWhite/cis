        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('16-bit'); ?>
        <p>In computer architecture, <strong>16-bit</strong> integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are at most 16 bits (2 <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('octets', 'IT'); ?>) wide. Also, 16-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 16-bit is also a term given to a generation of microcomputers in which 16-bit microprocessors were the norm.</p>
        <p></p>A 16-bit register can store 216 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 through 32,767 (unsigned: 0 through 65,535). Hence, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64KB of byte addressable memory.</p>
