        <p>A <strong>smartphone</strong> (or <strong>smart phone</strong>) is a mobile phone with more advanced computing capability and connectivity than basic feature phones.</p>
        <p>Early smartphones typically combined the features of a mobile phone with those of another popular consumer device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a media player, a digital camera, or a GPS navigation unit.</p>
        <p>Modern smartphones include all of those features plus the features of a touchscreen computer, including Web browsing, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi', 'ITN'); ?>, and 3rd-party apps.</p>
        <p>Currently, about 90% of handset sales worldwide are for devices driven by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> mobile operating systems.</p>
