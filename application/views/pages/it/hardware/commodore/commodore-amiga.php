        <p>The <strong>Amiga</strong> is a family of personal computers sold by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore', 'C'); ?> in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model, the A1000, was launched in 1985 and became popular for its graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore 64', 'ITH'); ?>, and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The name "<em>Amiga</em>" was chosen because it is the Spanish word for (female) friend, and alphabetically it appears before <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?> in lists of computer makers. It originated as a project code-named "<em>Lorraine</em>", therefore the female was used instead of the male and general version Amigo.</p>
        <p>The best selling model, the Amiga 500, was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with approximately six million sold. The A3000, introduced in 1990, started the second generation of Amiga Systems, followed by the A500+ and the A600. Finally, as the third generation, the A1200 and the A4000 were released in 1992. However, poor marketing and failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the fourth generation game consoles, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatibles', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 68000', 'CPU'); ?> family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The original operating system, partly based on <strong>TRIPOS</strong> and written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BCPL', 'L'); ?>, is called <strong>AmigaDOS</strong> and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?> is called <strong>Workbench</strong>. When it was eventually renamed <strong>AmigaOS</strong>, the BCPL parts were rewritten in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?> language.</p>
