        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Video Card'); ?>
        <p>A <strong>video card</strong> (also called a <strong>video adapter</strong>, <strong>display card</strong>, <strong>graphics card</strong>, <strong>graphics board</strong>, <strong>display adapter</strong> or <strong>graphics adapter</strong>) is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display (such as a computer monitor). Frequently, these are advertised as discrete or dedicated graphics cards, emphasising the distinction between these and integrated graphics. Within the industry, video cards are sometimes called graphics add-in-boards, abbreviated as AIBs, with the word "graphics" usually omitted.</p>
        <p>Standards such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MDA', 'VID'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CGA', 'VID'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HGC', 'VID'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Tandy', 'VID'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PGC', 'VID'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('EGA', 'VID'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VGA', 'VID'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MCGA', 'VID'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8514', 'VID'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XGA', 'VID'); ?> were introduced from 1982 to 1990 and supported by a variety of hardware manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Virtually all current video cards are built with either <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AMD', 'C'); ?> sourced or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Nvidia', 'C'); ?> sourced graphics chips. Most video cards offer various functions such as accelerated rendering of 3D scenes and 2D graphics, MPEG-2 / MPEG-4 decoding, TV output, or the ability to connect multiple monitors (multi-monitor).</p>
