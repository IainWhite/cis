        <p>The <strong>Amstrad PCW</strong> series was a range of personal computers produced by British company <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Amstrad', 'C'); ?> from 1985 to 1998, and also sold under licence in Europe as the "<em>Joyce</em>" by the German electronics company <strong>Schneider</strong> in the early years of the series' life.</p>
        <p>When it was launched, the cost of a PCW system was under 25% of the cost of almost all <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM compatible PC', 'PC'); ?> systems in the UK.</p>
        <p>As a result PCWs became very popular in the home and small office markets, both in the UK and in Europe.</p>
        <p>However the last two models, introduced in the mid 1990s, were commercial failures, being squeezed out of the market by the falling prices, greater capabilities and wider range of software for IBM compatible PCs.</p>
        <p>In all models, including the last, the monitor's casing included the CPU, RAM, floppy disk drives and power supply for all of the systems' components.</p>
        <p>All except the last included a printer in the price.</p>
        <p>Early models used 3-inch floppy disks, while those sold from 1991 onwards used 3.5 inch floppies, which became the industry standard around the time the PCW series was launched.</p>
        <p>A variety of inexpensive products and services were launched to copy 3 inch floppies to the 3.5 inch format so that data could be transferred to other machines.</p>
        <p>All models except the last included the <strong>Locoscript word processing program</strong>, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M Plus', 'OS'); ?> operating system, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mallard BASIC', 'BAS'); ?> and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('LOGO', 'L'); ?> programming language at no extra cost.</p>
        <p>A wide range of other CP/M office software and several games became available, some commercially produced and some free.</p>
        <p>Although Amstrad supplied all but the last model as text based systems, graphical user interface peripherals and the supporting software also became available.</p>
        <p>The last model had its own unique GUI operating system and set of office applications, which were included in the price.</p>
        <p>However none of the software for previous PCW models could run on this system.</p>
