        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Amstrad PC1512 / PC1640'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Amstrad PC1512</strong> was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Amstrad', 'C'); ?>'s mostly <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatible', 'PC'); ?> computer system, first manufactured in 1986.</p>
        <p>It was later succeeded by the <strong>PC1640</strong>.</p>
        <p>It launched for 499GBP and sold very well, as it was one of the first cheap PCs in Europe.</p>
        <p>It significantly helped open up the European PC market to consumers as well as businesses, and Amstrad's advertising of the PC1512 was aimed at homes rather than offices.</p>
        <p>The 1512's influence was such that the UK PC magazine <strong>PC Plus</strong> originally targeted itself at the "<em>Amstrad PC 1512 and compatibles</em>", since home ownership of other PCs at the time was rare.</p>
        <p>The PC1512 shipped with 512K of RAM; it could be upgraded to 640K of RAM with an expansion pack commonly known as a "<em>top hat</em>".</p>
        <p>Video output was compatible with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CGA', 'ITH'); ?> standard, with an extension allowing all 16 colours to be used in the 640x200 graphics mode.</p>
        <p>The CPU of both the PC1512 and the later PC1640 was an 8MHz <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8086', 'CPU'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The power supply was located in the monitor, which made upgrading difficult.</p>
        <p>Amstrad licensed both <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'OS'); ?> 3.2 and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Research DOS Plus', 'ITS'); ?>, which was largely compatible with MS-DOS and included some features from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?> and the ability to read CP/M disks. Only one of these operating systems could be used at a time.</p>
        <p>They also licensed the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GEM', 'OS'); ?> windowing system, which supported the customized CGA hardware of the 1512.</p>
        <p>The PC1512 was followed by the PC1640, which had 640KB of RAM and an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('EGA', 'ITH'); ?> compatible graphics chipset (though only the ECD model could display all EGA modes).</p>
        <p>Either model shipped with one or two 5.25" floppy drives, and optionally a hard drive (either 10M or 20M).</p>
        <p>The input devices supplied with the machine were notable.</p>
        <p>The mouse was an Amstrad Mouse, which was incompatible with serial mice common at the time.</p>
        <p>It was supported by some games, including <strong>Elite</strong>, but many DOS programs had problems with it.</p>
        <p>The keyboard sported an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Atari', 'C'); ?> compatible joystick port for digital joysticks.</p>
        <p>Joystick movements and buttons were mapped to unused keyboard codes, allowing the joystick to be used in many DOS games that were written for keyboard control.</p>
        <p>The series was somewhat unusual for the fact that it had a physical volume control on the internal speaker.</p>
        <p>This allowed the user to make the machine beep quietly, or silently, from boot time onwards.</p>
