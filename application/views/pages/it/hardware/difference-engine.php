        <p>A <strong>difference engine</strong> is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions.</p>
        <p>The name derives from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial coefficients.</p>
        <p>Both logarithmic and trigonometric functions, functions commonly used by both navigators and scientists, can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful sets of numbers.</p>
        <p>The historical difficulty in producing error-free tables by teams of mathematicians and human "computers" spurred <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Charles Babbage', 'P'); ?>'s desire to build a mechanism to automate the process.</p>
