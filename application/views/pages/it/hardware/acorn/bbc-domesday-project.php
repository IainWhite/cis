        <p><strong>The BBC Domesday Project</strong> was a partnership between <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn Computers', 'C'); ?>, <strong>Philips</strong>, <strong>Logica</strong> and the <strong>BBC</strong> (with some funding from the European Commission's ESPRIT programme) to mark the 900th anniversary of the original Domesday Book, an 11th century census of England.</p>
        <p>It is frequently cited as an example of digital obsolescence on account of the physical medium used for data storage.</p>
        <p>This new multimedia edition of Domesday was compiled between 1984 and 1986 and published in 1986.</p>
        <p>It included a new "<em>survey</em>" of the United Kingdom, in which people, mostly school children, wrote about geography, history or social issues in their local area or just about their daily lives. Children from over 9,000 schools were involved.</p>
        <p>This was linked with maps, and many colour photos, statistical data, video and "virtual walks".</p>
        <p>Over 1 million people participated in the project.</p>
        <p>The project also incorporated professionally prepared video footage, virtual reality tours of major landmarks and other prepared datasets such as the 1981 census.</p>
        <p>The project was stored on adapted laserdiscs in the LaserVision Read Only Memory (LV-ROM) format, which contained not only analogue video and still pictures, but also digital data, with 300M of storage space on each side of the disc.</p>
        <p>Data and images were selected and collated by the BBC Domesday project based in Bilton House in West Ealing.</p>
        <p>Pre-mastering of data was carried out on a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC', 'C'); ?>  VAX-11/750 mini-computer, assisted by a network of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Micros', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The discs were mastered, produced, and tested by the <strong>Philips Laservision</strong> factory in Blackburn, England. Viewing the discs required an Acorn BBC Master expanded with a SCSI controller and an additional coprocessor controlled a Philips VP415 "Domesday Player", a specially produced laserdisc player.</p>
        <p>The user interface consisted of the BBC Master's keyboard and a trackball (known at the time as a trackerball).</p>
        <p>The software for the project was written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BCPL', 'L'); ?> (a precursor to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?>), to make cross platform porting easier, although BCPL never attained the popularity that its early promise suggested it might.</p>
