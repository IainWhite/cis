        <p>The <strong>Acorn Archimedes</strong> was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn Computers', 'C'); ?> first general purpose home computer to be based on their own <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ARM architecture', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Using a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RISC', 'CPU'); ?> design with a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('32-bit', 'ITH'); ?> CPU (26-bit addressing), at its launch in June 1987, the Archimedes was stated as running at 4 MIPS, with a claim of 18 MIPS during tests.</p>
        <p>The name is commonly used to describe any of Acorn's contemporary designs based on the same architecture, even where Acorn did not include Archimedes in the official name.</p>
        <p>The Archimedes was one of the most powerful home computers available during the late 1980s and early 1990s; its main CPU was faster than the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 68000', 'CPU'); ?> microprocessors found in the more popular <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore Amiga', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Atari ST', 'ITH'); ?> machines.</p>
