        <p>The <strong>Acorn Electron</strong> was a budget version of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Micro', 'ITH'); ?> educational / home computer made by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn Computers Ltd', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It had 32 kilobytes of RAM, and its ROM includes <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC BASIC', 'BAS'); ?> v2 along with its operating system.</p>
        <p>The Electron was able to save and load programs onto audio cassette via a supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard tape recorder that had the correct sockets.</p>
        <p>It was capable of basic graphics, and could display onto either a television set, a colour (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RGB', 'ITH'); ?>) monitor or a "green screen" monitor.</p>
        <p>At its peak, the Electron was the third best selling micro in the United Kingdom, and total lifetime game sales for the Electron exceeded those of the BBC Micro.</p>
