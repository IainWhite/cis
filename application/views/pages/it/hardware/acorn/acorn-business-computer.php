        <p>The <strong>Acorn Business Computer (ABC)</strong> was a series of microcomputers announced at the end of 1983 by the British company <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acorn Computers', 'C'); ?>. The series of eight computers was aimed at the business, research and further education markets. However, the ABC range was cancelled before any of the models were shipped to customers. The ABC 210 was subsequently relaunched as the <strong>Acorn Cambridge Workstation</strong>, sold in modest numbers to academic and scientific users.</p>
        <p>The ABC range was developed by Acorn essentially as a repackaged <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Micro', 'ITH'); ?>, expanded to 64K RAM, to which was added (in some models) a second processor and extra memory to complement the BBC Micro's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('6502', 'CPU'); ?>. The electronics and disk drives were integrated into the monitor housing, with a separate keyboard.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Zilog Z80', 'CPU'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 80286', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('National Semiconductor 32016', 'CPU'); ?> were all used as second processors in the various models. Two of the eight models produced, the <strong>Personal Assistant</strong> and the <strong>Terminal</strong>, had no second processor.</p>
