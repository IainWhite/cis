        <p><strong>Computer architecture</strong> is a set of disciplines that describe the functionality, organisation and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other descriptions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('microarchitecture', 'CPU'); ?> design, logic design, and implementation.</p>
