        <p>The <strong>Personal System/2</strong> or <strong>PS/2</strong> was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>'s third generation of personal computers released in 1987.</p>
        <p>The PS/2 line was created by IBM in an attempt to recapture control of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC', 'ITH'); ?> market by introducing an advanced yet proprietary architecture.</p>
        <p>IBM's considerable market presence plus the reliability of the PS/2 ensured that the systems would sell in relatively large numbers, especially to large businesses.</p>
        <p>However the other major manufacturers bulked at IBM's licensing terms to develop and sell compatible hardware, particularly as the demanded royalties were on a per machine basis.</p>
        <p>Also the evolving <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wintel', 'PC'); ?> architecture was seeing a period of dramatic reductions in price, and so these developments prevented the PS/2 from returning control of the PC market to IBM. </p>
        <p>Due to the higher costs of the architecture, customers preferred competing PCs that extended the existing PC architecture instead of abandoning it for something new.</p>
        <p>However, many of the PS/2's innovations, such as the 16550 UART (serial port), 1440K 3.5 inch floppy disk format, 72-pin SIMMs, the PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VGA', 'ITH'); ?> video standard, went on to become standards in the broader PC market.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?> operating system was announced at the same time as the PS/2 line and was intended to be the primary operating system for models with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 80286', 'CPU'); ?> or later processors. However, at the time of the first shipments, only <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC DOS', 'OS'); ?> was available. OS/2 1.0 (text-mode only) and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 2.0', 'WIN'); ?> became available several months later.</p>
        <p>IBM also released <strong>AIX PS/2</strong>, a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UNIX', 'OS'); ?> operating system for PS/2 models with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 80386', 'CPU'); ?> or later processors.</p>
