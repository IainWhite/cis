        <p><strong>IBM PC compatible</strong> computers are those similar to the original <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'PC'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XT', 'PC'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AT', 'PC'); ?> and able to run the same software as those.</p>
        <p>Such computers used to be referred to as <strong>PC clones</strong>, or <strong>IBM clones</strong>.</p>
        <p>They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>'s choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a "clean room design" technique.</p>
        <p>Most early IBM PC compatibles used the same computer bus as the original PC and AT models.</p>
        <p>The IBM AT compatible bus was later named the Industry Standard Architecture bus by manufacturers of compatible computers.</p>
        <p>The term "<em>IBM PC compatible</em>" is now a historical description only, since <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> has ended its personal computer sales.</p>
