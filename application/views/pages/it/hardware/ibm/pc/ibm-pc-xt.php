        <p>The <strong>IBM Personal Computer XT</strong>, often shortened to the <strong>IBM XT</strong>, <strong>PC XT</strong>, or simply <strong>XT</strong>, was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>''s successor to the original <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'PC'); ?>', factory equipped with a hard drive.</p>
        <p>It was released as IBM Machine Type number 5160 on 8 March 1983, and essentially the same as the original PC, with only incremental improvements.</p>
        <p><strong>XT</strong> stands for e<strong>X</strong>tended <strong>T</strong>echnology.</p>
        <p>A new 16-bit bus architecture would follow in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AT', 'PC'); ?>'.</p>
        <p>The XT was mainly intended as an enhanced machine for business use, though later floppy only models would effectively replace the original model 5150 PC.</p>
        <p>A corresponding 3270 PC featuring 3270 terminal emulation was released later in October 1983.</p>
        <p>The XT originally came with 128k of RAM, a 360k double-sided 5.25 in (133 mm) full-height floppy disk drive, a 10M Seagate ST-412 hard drive with Xebec 1210 MFM controller, an Asynchronous Adapter (serial card with 8250 UART) and a 130 watt power supply.</p>
        <p>The motherboard had an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8088', 'CPU'); ?>' microprocessor running at 4.77MHz, with a socket for an 8087 math coprocessor.</p>
        <p>The eight 8-bit ISA expansion slots were an increase over the five in the IBM PC, although slots were taken up by the floppy drive and hard drive adapters, the Async serial port card, and nearly always a display adapter board.</p>
        <p>The basic specification was soon upgraded to have 256k of RAM as standard. Expansion slots could be used for I/O devices or for main memory expansion.</p>
