        <p>The <strong>IBM PCjr</strong> (read "PC junior") was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>'s first attempt to enter the home computer market. The PCjr, IBM model number 4860, retains the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'ITH'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8088', 'CPU'); ?> CPU and BIOS interface for compatibility, but various design and implementation decisions led the PCjr to be a commercial failure.</p>
        <p>Announced 1 November 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984, the PCjr nicknamed "<em>Peanut</em>" before its debut came in two models: the 4860-004, with 64KB of memory, priced at US$669 and the 4860-067, with 128KB of memory and a 360KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1269. It was manufactured for IBM in Lewisburg, Tennessee by Teledyne. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the IBM PC, which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard PC speaker sound and color graphics of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.</p>
        <p>The graphics are produced by the Video Gate Array (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VGA', 'ITV'); ?>), an upward-compatible extension of Color Graphics Adapter (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CGA', 'ITV'); ?>) which adds three new graphics modes to CGA's seven. The PCjr's sound is provided by a Texas Instruments SN76489 which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a shift register. The PCjr is also the first PC compatible machine that supports page flipping for graphics operation. Since the PCjr uses system RAM to store video content and the location of this storage area can be changed, the PCjr can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are either difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.</p>
        <p>The PCjr's 4.77 MHz <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8088', 'CPU'); ?> CPU is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time, though the PCjr does not run at the full rated 4.77 MHz because every 4th clock cycle of the 8088 CPU is designated to refresh the PCjr's dynamic RAM as it has no dedicated memory controller; the computer's effective clockspeed is therefore 3.58 MHz. The detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's couch with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.</p>
