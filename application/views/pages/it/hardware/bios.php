        <p>The <strong>BIOS</strong> (an acronym for <strong>Basic Input/Output System</strong> and also known as the <strong>System BIOS</strong>, <strong>ROM BIOS</strong> or <strong>PC BIOS</strong>) is a type of firmware used during the booting process (power-on startup) on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatible', 'ITH'); ?> computers. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?> operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'ITH'); ?>, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a de facto standard.</p>
        <p>The fundamental purposes of the BIOS are to initialise and test the system hardware components, and to load a boot loader or an operating system from a mass memory device. The BIOS additionally provides an abstraction layer for the hardware, i.e. a consistent way for application programs and operating systems to interact with the keyboard, display, and other input/output (I/O) devices. Variations in the system hardware are hidden by the BIOS from programs that use BIOS services instead of directly accessing the hardware. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'DOS'); ?> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC DOS', 'DOS'); ?>), which was the dominant PC operating system from the early 1980s until the mid 1990s, relied on BIOS services for disk, keyboard, and text display functions. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS Windows NT', 'WIN'); ?>, [Linux]<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>, and other protected mode operating systems in general ignore the abstraction layer provided by the BIOS and do not use it after loading, instead accessing the hardware components directly.</p>
        <p>Every BIOS implementation is specifically designed to work with a particular computer or motherboard model, by interfacing with various devices that make up the complementary system chipset. Originally, BIOS firmware was stored in a ROM chip on the PC motherboard; in modern computer systems, the BIOS contents are stored on flash memory so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard. This allows easy updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS rootkits.</p>
