        <p>The <strong>Gold key</strong> is a computer keyboard key used as a prefix to invoke a variety of single-key editing and formatting functions. Usually located in the top-left position of the numeric keypad on platforms such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VT100', 'VT'); ?>, it is the signature element of a consistent user interface implemented by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Equipment Corporation', 'C'); ?> across multiple product lines.</p>
        <p>It is used within WPS, EDT, and many other common <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VAX', 'ITH'); ?> programs. The key, typically located as the upper leftmost key on the numeric keypad on different terminals, was not necessarily coloured gold. Some Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) terminals would include keyboards where the gold key was labeled PF1, as on the VT100 and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VT200', 'VT'); ?>, or was coloured blue, as on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VT52', 'VT'); ?>. On some keyboards, the normal function of a key would be labeled on the lower portion of the key, while its alternate function activated with the GOLD key would be labeled above it.</p>
        <p>The Gold Key is used to invoke single-key functions which may be located on either the main keyboard or the numeric keypad. For example, on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WPS-8', 'ITS'); ?> word processing system, the main keyboard key C is marked “CENTR”, in gold lettering, on its front surface; the keystrokes GOLDC invoke that word processing function to center the current line of text.</p>
        <p>The Gold key is a prefix key, not a modifier key. A modifier key would be pressed and held while a second key is pressed; the Gold key is pressed and released before a second key is pressed and released. In that sense, DEC and compatible software uses the Gold key in the same way that <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Emacs', 'IDE'); ?> uses the escape key.</p>
