        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Nibble'); ?>
        <p>In computing, a <strong>nibble</strong> (often <strong>nybble</strong> or even <strong>nyble</strong> to match the vowels of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('byte', 'IT'); ?>) is a four-bit aggregation, or half an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('octet', 'IT'); ?>. It is also known as half-byte, quadruple, or tetrade. In a networking or telecommunication context, the nibble is often called a semi-octet or a quartet. As a nibble contains 4 bits, there are sixteen (24) possible values. A nibble can be represented by a single hexadecimal digit and called a "hex digit".</p>
        <p>A full byte (octet) is represented by two hexadecimal digits; therefore, it is common to display a byte of information as two nibbles. Sometimes the set of all 256 byte values is represented as a table 16x16, which gives easily readable hexadecimal codes for each value.</p>
