        <p><strong>Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)</strong> is the use of computer software to control machine tools and related machinery in the manufacturing of workpieces. This is not the only definition for CAM, but it is the most common; CAM may also refer to the use of a computer to assist in all operations of a manufacturing plant, including planning, management, transportation and storage. Its primary purpose is to create a faster production process and components and tooling with more precise dimensions and material consistency, which in some cases, uses only the required amount of raw material (thus minimising waste), while simultaneously reducing energy consumption. CAM is a subsequent computer aided process after <strong>Computer Aided Design (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CAD', 'ITS'); ?>)</strong> and sometimes <strong>Computer Aided Engineering (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CAE', 'IT'); ?>)</strong>, as the model generated in CAD and verified in CAE can be input into CAM software, which then controls the machine tool.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, CAM has been considered as a <strong>Numerical Control (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NC', 'IT'); ?>)</strong> programming tool, where in two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) models of components generated in CADAs with other “Computer Aided” technologies, CAM does not eliminate the need for skilled professionals such as manufacturing engineers, NC programmers, or machinists. CAM, in fact, leverages both the value of the most skilled manufacturing professionals through advanced productivity tools, while building the skills of new professionals through visualisation, simulation and optimisation tools.</p>
