        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Byte'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('bits', 'IT'); ?> used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. The de facto standard of eight bits is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte. The international standard IEC 80000-13 codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8-bit', 'ITH'); ?> size.</p>
        <p>The unit octet was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of 8 bits because of the ambiguity associated at the time with the byte.</p>
        <p>The term byte was coined by <strong>Werner Buchholz</strong> in July 1956, during the early design phase for the <strong>IBM Stretch</strong> computer, which had addressing to the bit and variable field length (VFL) instructions with a byte size encoded in the instruction. It is a deliberate respelling of bite to avoid accidental mutation to bit.</p>
