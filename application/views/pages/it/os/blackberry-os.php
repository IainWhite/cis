        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('BlackBerry OS'); ?>
        <p><strong>BlackBerry OS</strong> is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BlackBerry Ltd', 'C'); ?> for its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BlackBerry', 'ITH'); ?> line of smartphone handheld devices. The operating system provides multitasking and supports specialised input devices that have been adopted by BlackBerry Ltd. for use in its handhelds, particularly the trackwheel, trackball, and most recently, the trackpad and touchscreen.</p>
        <p>The BlackBerry platform is perhaps best known for its native support for corporate email, through MIDP 1.0 and, more recently, a subset of MIDP 2.0, which allows complete wireless activation and synchronisation with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Exchange', 'ITS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lotus Domino', 'ITS'); ?>, or <strong>Novell GroupWise</strong> email, calendar, tasks, notes, and contacts, when used with BlackBerry Enterprise Server. The operating system also supports <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WAP', 'ITN'); ?> 1.2.</p>
        <p>Updates to the operating system may be automatically available from wireless carriers that support the BlackBerry over the air software loading (OTASL) service.</p>
        <p>Third-party developers can write software using the available BlackBerry API classes, although applications that make use of certain functionality must be digitally signed.</p>
        <p>BlackBerry OS was discontinued after the release of BlackBerry 10, but BlackBerry will continue support for the BlackBerry OS.</p>
