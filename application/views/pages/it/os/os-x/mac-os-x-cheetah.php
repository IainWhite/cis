        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Mac OS X Cheetah'); ?>
        <p><strong>Mac OS X version 10.0</strong>, code named <strong>Cheetah</strong>, is the first major release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>’s desktop and server operating system. Mac OS X v10.0 was released on 24 March 2001 for a price of US$129. It was the successor of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X Public Beta', 'OSX'); ?> and the predecessor of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X 10.1', 'OSX'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Mac OS X v10.0 was a radical departure from the previous classic Macintosh operating system (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?>) and was Apple’s long awaited answer for a next generation Macintosh operating system. It introduced a brand new code base completely separate from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS 9', 'MOS'); ?>'s, as well as all previous Apple operating systems. Mac OS X introduced the new <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Darwin', 'OS'); ?> Unix-like core and a completely new system of memory management. Cheetah proved to be a rocky start to the Mac OS X line, plagued with missing features and performance issues, although it was praised for being a good start to an operating system still in its infancy, in terms of completeness and overall operating system stability. Unlike later releases of Mac OS X, the cat-themed code name was not used in marketing the new operating system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dock - the Dock was a new way of organizing one's Mac OS X applications on a user interface, and a change from the classic method of Application launching in previous Mac OS systems.</li>
            <li>Mach 3.0 - the Mach 3.0 microkernel was part of the XNU kernel for Mac OS X, and was one of the largest changes from a technical standpoint in Mac OS X.</li>
            <li>Terminal - the Terminal was a feature that allowed access to Mac OS X's underpinnings, namely the Unix core. Mac OS had previously had the distinction of being one of the few operating systems with no command line interface at all.</li>
            <li>Mail - email client.</li>
            <li>Address Book</li>
            <li>TextEdit - new on-board word processor, replacement to SimpleText.</li>
            <li>Full preemptive multitasking support, a long awaited feature on the Mac.</li>
            <li>PDF Support (create PDFs from any application)</li>
            <li>Aqua UI - new user interface</li>
            <li>Built on Darwin, a Unix-like operating system.</li>
            <li>OpenGL</li>
            <li>AppleScript</li>
            <li>Support for Carbon and Cocoa APIs</li>
            <li>Sherlock - desktop and web search engine.</li>
            <li>Protected memory - memory protection so that if an application corrupts its memory, the memory of other applications will not be corrupted.</li>
