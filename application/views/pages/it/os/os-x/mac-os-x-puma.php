        <p><strong>Mac OS X version 10.1</strong>, code named <strong>Puma</strong>, is the second major release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>'s desktop and server operating system. It superseded <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X 10.0', 'OSX'); ?> and preceded <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X 10.2', 'OSX'); ?>. Version 10.1 was released on 25 September 2001 as a free update for Mac OS X 10.0 users. The operating system was handed out for no charge by Apple employees after <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Job', 'P'); ?>'s keynote speech at the Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco. It was subsequently distributed to Mac users on 25 October 2001 at Apple Stores and other retail stores that carried Apple products. The operating system was better received than Mac OS X 10.0, although critics claimed that the operating system was still lacking some features and was plagued with bugs.</p>
        <p>Apple introduced many features that were missing from the previous version, as well as improving overall system performance.</p>
        <p>This system release brought some major new features to the Mac OS X platform:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Performance enhancements - Mac OS X v10.1 introduced large performance increases throughout the system.</li>
            <li>Easier CD and DVD burning - better support in Finder as well as in iTunes</li>
            <li>DVD playback support - DVDs can be played in Apple DVD Player</li>
            <li>More printer support (200 printers supported out of the box) - One of the main complaints of version 10.0 users was the lack of printer drivers, and Apple attempted to remedy the situation by including more drivers, although many critics complained that there were still not enough.</li>
            <li>Faster 3D (OpenGL performs 20% faster) - The OpenGL drivers, and handling were vastly improved in this version of Mac OS X, which created a large performance gap for 3D elements in the interface, and 3D applications.</li>
            <li>Improved AppleScript - The scripting interface now allows scripting access to many more system components, such as the Printer Center, and Terminal, thus improving the customizability of the interface. As well, Apple introduced AppleScript Studio, which allows a user to create full AppleScript applications in a simple graphical interface.</li>
            <li>Improved filehandling - The Finder was enhanced to optionally hide file extensions on a per-file basis. The Cocoa API was enhanced to allow developers to set traditional Mac type and creator information directly without relying on Carbon to do it.</li>
            <li>ColorSync 4.0, the color management system and API.</li>
            <li>Image Capture, for acquiring images from digital cameras and scanners.</li>
        </ul>
