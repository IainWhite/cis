        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('OS X Mavericks'); ?>
        <p><strong>OS X Mavericks (version 10.9)</strong> is the tenth major release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>'s desktop and server operating system for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> computers. OS X Mavericks was announced on 10 June 2013, at WWDC 2013, and was released on 22 October 2013, as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide.</p>
        <p>The update places emphasis on battery life, Finder enhancements, other enhancements for power users, and continued iCloud integration, as well as bringing more of Apple's iOS apps to the OS X platform. Mavericks marks the beginning of a change in the naming scheme of OS X, departing from the use of big cats and moving to names based on places in California; OS X Mavericks is named after the surfing location in California.</p>
