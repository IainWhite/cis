        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Mac OS X Jaguar'); ?>
        <p><strong>Mac OS X version 10.2 Jaguar</strong> is the third major release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>'s desktop and server operating system. It superseded <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X 10.1', 'OSX'); ?> and preceded <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS X Panther', 'OS'); ?>. The operating system was initially available on 23 August 2002 either for single-computer installations, and in a “family pack”, which allowed five installations on separate computers in one household.[2] The operating system was generally well received by most Mac users as a large step forward in the areas of stability, general speed enhancements, compatibility with other flavours of [Unix] and the lineup of both graphical and terminal applications available; however, many critics, such as Amazon.com users, still claimed that significant user interface speed issues existed and that the operating system was still a big step down from [Mac OS 9]. Jaguar was the first Mac OS X release to publicly use its code name in marketing and advertisements, a practice that has continued in subsequent releases of the operating system.</p>
        <p>Apple advertised that Mac OS X v10.2 Jaguar had new features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Address Book - A system-wide repository for contact information in the updated Address Book.</li>
            <li>Rendezvous (later named Bonjour) - Apple's implementation of an IETF open protocol (Zeroconf) that allows devices over a network to essentially ‘find each other’ with a directory listing service. For example, a Bonjour-enabled printer connected to a network, could find and connect to a Bonjour-enabled computer without any user configuration. This technology is used today in applications like iTunes music sharing and iChat Bonjour messaging.</li>
            <li>CUPS (Common Unix Printing System), the modular printing system for Unix-like operating systems.</li>
            <li>Finder - A revamped Finder with search box built into every window.</li>
            <li>Mail - An email client with an adaptive spam mail filter.</li>
            <li>Network support for Windows networks - Increased support for networks in Jaguar. Apple added much more support for Windows networks, and sharing protocols. Most of the changes were added behind the scenes, which included new Samba tools, and new printing protocols.</li>
            <li>Quartz Extreme - Quartz Extreme was added for compositing graphics directly on the video card, without the use of software to composite windows. The technology allotted the task of drawing the 3D surface of windows to the generally idle graphics processing unit, rather than to the central processing unit. Overall, the technology benefited the areas of user interface responsiveness and general speed enhancements throughout.</li>
            <li>Sherlock 3 - Internet services</li>
            <li>Universal Access - Set of features made specially for disabled people.</li>
            <li>QuickTime 6 has MPEG-4 support</li>
            <li>Increased speed across the entire system.</li>
            <li>Journaled file system (first introduced in 10.2.3 Server, later made available to 10.2.x clients).</li>
        </ul>
