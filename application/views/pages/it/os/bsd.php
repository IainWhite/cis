        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('BSD - Berkeley Software Distribution'); ?>
        <p><strong>Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)</strong> was a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Operating System', 'IT'); ?> derivative developed and distributed by the <strong>Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG)</strong> of the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>, from 1977 to 1995. Today the term "BSD" is often used non-specifically to refer to any of the BSD descendants which together form a branch of the family of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix-like', 'OS'); ?> operating systems. Operating systems derived from the original BSD code remain actively developed and widely used.</p>
        <p>Historically, BSD has been considered a branch of Unix, Berkeley Unix, because it shared the initial codebase and design with the original AT&amp;T Unix operating system. In the 1980s, BSD was widely adopted by vendors of workstation-class systems in the form of proprietary Unix variants such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC ULTRIX', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sun Microsystems SunOS', 'OS'); ?>. This can be attributed to the ease with which it could be licensed, and the familiarity the founders of many technology companies of the time had with it.</p>
        <p>Although these proprietary BSD derivatives were largely superseded by the UNIX System V Release 4 and OSF/1 systems in the 1990s (both of which incorporated BSD code and are the basis of other modern Unix systems), later BSD releases provided a basis for several open source development projects, e.g. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FreeBSD', 'OS'); ?>, OpenBSD, NetBSD, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Darwin', 'OS'); ?> or PC-BSD, that are ongoing. These, in turn, have been incorporated in whole or in part in modern proprietary operating systems, e.g. the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TCP/IP', 'IPS'); ?> networking code in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> and most of the foundation of Apple's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
