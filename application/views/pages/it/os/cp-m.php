        <p><strong>CP/M</strong> (<strong>Control Program for Microcomputers</strong>) was a mass market operating system created for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8080', 'CPU'); ?>/85 based microcomputers by <strong>Gary Kildall</strong> of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Research Inc', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Initially confined to single-tasking on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8-bit', 'IT'); ?> processors and no more than 64 kilobytes of memory, later versions of CP/M added multi-user variations, and were migrated to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('16-bit', 'IT'); ?> processors.</p>
        <p>The combination of CP/M and S-100 bus computers loosely patterned on the MITS Altair was an early "industry standard" for microcomputers, and this computer platform was widely used in business through the late 1970s and into the mid 1980s, expanding to include 16-bit CPUs and multiuser capability.</p>
        <p>By greatly reducing the amount of programming required to install an application on a new manufacturer's computer, CP/M increased the market size for both hardware and software.</p>
        <p>The acronym CP/M for "Control Program/Monitor" was later backronymed to "Control Program for Microcomputers".</p>
