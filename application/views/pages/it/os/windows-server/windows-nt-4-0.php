        <p><strong>Windows NT 4.0</strong> is a graphical <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Operating System', 'IT'); ?>, designed to work with either uniprocessor or symmetric multi-processor computers. It was part of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT', 'WIS'); ?> line of operating systems and was released to manufacturing on 31 July 1996. It is a 32-bit Windows system available in both workstation and server editions with a graphical environment similar to that of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The successor to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT 3.51', 'WIS'); ?>, Windows NT 4.0 introduced the user interface of Windows 95 to the Windows NT product line, including the Windows Shell, Windows Explorer (known as Windows NT Explorer), and the use of "My" nomenclature (e.g. My Computer). It also includes most applications introduced with Windows 95. Internally, Windows NT 4.0 was known as the Shell Update Release (SUR). Various administrative tools, notably User Manager for Domains, Server Manager and Domain Name Service Manager have improved graphical user interfaces. The Start Menu in Windows NT 4.0 separated the per-user shortcuts and folders from the All users shortcuts and folders by a separator line. Windows NT 4.0 includes some enhancements from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 such as the Space Cadet pinball table, font smoothing, full window drag, high color icons and stretching the wallpaper to fit the screen. Windows Desktop Update could also be installed on Windows NT 4.0 to update the shell version and install Task Scheduler. The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit included the Desktop Themes utility.</p>
        <p>Windows NT 4.0 is the last major release of Microsoft Windows to support the Alpha, MIPS or PowerPC CPU architectures. It remained in use by businesses for a number of years, despite Microsoft's many efforts to get customers to upgrade to [Windows 2000] and newer versions. It was also the last release in the Windows NT line to be branded as Windows NT.</p>
