        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Windows NT'); ?>
        <p><strong>Windows NT</strong> is a family of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Operating System', 'IT'); ?> produced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>, the first version of which was released in July 1993. It is a processor-independent, multiprocessing, multi-user operating system.</p>
        <p>The first version of Windows NT was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT 3.1', 'WIS'); ?> and was produced for workstations and server computers. It was intended to complement consumer versions of Windows (including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 1.0', 'WIN'); ?> through <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 3.1x', 'WIN'); ?>) that were based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'OS'); ?>. Gradually, the Windows NT family was expanded into Microsoft's general-purpose operating system product line for all personal computers, deprecating the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 9x', 'WIN'); ?> family.</p>
        <p>"<em>NT</em>" was formerly expanded to "<em>New Technology</em>" but no longer carries any specific meaning. Starting with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 2000', 'WIS'); ?>, "NT" was removed from the product name and is only included in the product version string.</p>
        <p>NT was the first purely 32-bit version of Windows, whereas its consumer-oriented counterparts, Windows 3.1x and Windows 9x, were 16-bit / 32-bit hybrids. It is a multi-architecture operating system. Initially, it supported several CPU architectures, including IA-32, MIPS, DEC Alpha and PowerPC. The latest versions support x86 (more specifically IA-32 and x64) and ARM. Major features of Windows NT family include Windows Shell, Windows API, Native API, Active Directory, Group Policy, Hardware Abstraction Layer, NTFS file system, BitLocker, Windows Store, Windows Update, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Hyper-V', 'IT'); ?>.</p>
