        <p><strong>Windows NT 3.1</strong> is a 32-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Operating System', 'IT'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>. It constitutes the first operating system of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT', 'WIS'); ?> family and was released on 27 July 1993. Although it is the first version in the NT line, the name was chosen as a brand extension of the similar <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 3.1', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The architecture of Windows NT 3.1 was designed from scratch, and was originally intended to be a rewrite of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?> operating system that Microsoft had co-developed with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>; however, the popularity of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 3.0', 'WIN'); ?> resulted in a change to a more Windows-like architecture, a change which subsequently resulted in IBM discontinuing its partnership with Microsoft. The central design goals were portability to multiple processor architectures, as well as higher security and stability than the previous <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>-based operating systems. Windows NT 3.1 was released in a workstation variant, called just <strong>Windows NT 3.1</strong>, and a server variant called <strong>Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server</strong>.</p>
        <p>The operating system's success on the market was only limited, mostly due to the high system requirements for its time and the lack of 32-bit applications which used the capabilities of Windows NT 3.1. Nevertheless, the operating system laid the foundation for all future releases of the Windows NT line.</p>
