        <p><strong>RPM Package Manager (RPM)</strong> (originally <strong>Red Hat Package Manager</strong>; now a recursive initialism) is a package management system. The name RPM variously refers to the <code>.rpm</code> file format, files in this format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager itself. RPM was intended primarily for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> distributions; the file format is the baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base.</p>
        <p>Even though it was created for use in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Red Hat Linux', 'LIN'); ?>, RPM is now used in many GNU/Linux distributions. It has also been ported to some other operating systems, such as Novell NetWare (as of version 6.5 SP3) and IBM's AIX (as of version 4).</p>
