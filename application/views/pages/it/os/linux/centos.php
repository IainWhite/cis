        <p><strong>CentOS</strong> ("<strong>Community Enterprise Operating System</strong>") is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> distribution that attempts to provide a free enterprise class computing platform which has 100% binary compatibility with its upstream source, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Red Hat Enterprise Linux', 'LIN'); ?> (<strong>RHEL</strong>).</p>
        <p>The first CentOS was based upon RHEL version 2.1AS, and was numbered as CentOS version 2.</p>
        <p>Originally, CentOS Linux was a build artifact for <strong>cAos Linux</strong>. Several of the cAos contributors at the time were really just interested in this build artifact for their own use, citing difficulties in collaborating with other noteworthy RHEL clones of the time.</p>

            <h2>CentOS Versions</h2>
            <p>CentOS version numbers have two parts, a major version and a minor version, which correspond to the major version and update set of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that was used to build that version of CentOS. For example, CentOS 4.7 is built from the source packages from RHEL 4 update 7.</p>
            <p>Since mid-2006, starting with version 4.4 (formally known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.0 update 4), Red Hat has adopted a versioning convention identical to that of CentOS, e.g., RHEL 4.5</p>
