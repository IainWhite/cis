        <p><strong>Linux Mint</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux distribution', 'LIN'); ?> based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ubuntu', 'LIN'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Debian', 'LIN'); ?>, with an alternative <strong>Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)</strong> based purely on Debian. Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including some proprietary software such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Flash', 'IT'); ?>.</p>
        <p>New versions of the Ubuntu based Linux Mint have been released approximately every six months. The first release, named "<strong>Ada</strong>", was released in 2006. The 17th release, "<strong>Qiana</strong>", was released on 31 May 2014. Support for older releases usually ends shortly after the next version is released, but there have been releases with long-term support, including the current release, v17.x, which will be supported for five years, until April 2019.</p>
