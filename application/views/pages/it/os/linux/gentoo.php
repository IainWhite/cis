        <p><strong>Gentoo Linux</strong> is a computer operating system based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> kernel and built using the Portage package management system. It is distributed as free and open-source software. Unlike a binary software distribution, the source code is compiled locally according to the user's preferences and is often optimised for the specific type of computer. Precompiled binaries are available for some very large packages and for packages whose source code has not been released.</p>
        <p>The "<em>Gentoo</em>" name comes from the fast-swimming Gentoo penguin. It was chosen to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine-specific optimisation. Gentoo package management is designed to be modular, portable, easy to maintain, and flexible. Gentoo is sometimes described as a meta-distribution, "because of its near unlimited adaptability", in that the majority of users have configurations and sets of installed programs which are unique to themselves.</p>
