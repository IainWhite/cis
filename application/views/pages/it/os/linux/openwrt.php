        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('OpenWrt'); ?>
        <p><strong>OpenWrt</strong> is an operating system (in particular, an embedded operating system) based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux kernel', 'OS'); ?>, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic. The main components are the Linux kernel, util-linux, uClibc or musl and BusyBox. All components have been optimised for size, to be small enough for fitting into the limited storage and memory available in home routers.</p>
        <p>OpenWrt is configured using a command-line interface (ash shell), or a web interface (LuCI). There are about 3500 optional software packages available for installation via the opkg package management system.</p>
        <p>OpenWrt can run on various types of devices, including CPE routers, residential gateways, smartphones (e.g. Neo FreeRunner), pocket computers (e.g. Ben NanoNote), and laptops (e.g. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('One Laptop per Child', 'IT'); ?> (OLPC)). It is also possible to run OpenWrt on ordinary computers, which are most commonly based on the x86 architecture. Many patches from the OpenWrt's codebase have been included upstream in the Linux kernel mainline.</p>
