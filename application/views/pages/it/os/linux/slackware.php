        <p><strong>Slackware</strong> is a free and open source <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> distribution.</p>
        <p>It was one of the earliest operating systems to be built on top of the Linux kernel and is the oldest currently being maintained.</p>
        <p>Slackware was created by <strong>Patrick Volkerding</strong> of <strong>Slackware Linux Inc</strong> in 1993.</p>
        <p>Slackware aims for design stability and simplicity, and to be the most "Unix-like" Linux distribution, making as few modifications as possible to software packages from upstream and using plain text files and a small set of shell scripts for configuration and administration</p>
