        <p><strong>Tux</strong> is a penguin character and the official mascot of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux kernel', 'OS'); ?>. Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition, Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux, although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles.</p>
        <p>The concept of the Linux mascot being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial suggestion made by Alan Cox and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list. Torvalds took his inspiration from a photograph he found on an FTP site, showing a penguin figurine looking strangely like the Creature Comforts characters made by Nick Park.</p>
        <p>The first person to call the penguin "Tux" was James Hughes, who said that it stood for "<strong>T</strong>orvalds <strong>U</strong>ni<strong>X</strong>". However, tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo, the outfit which springs to mind when one sees a penguin.</p>
        <p>Tux was originally designed as a submission for a Linux logo contest. Three such competitions took place; Tux won none of them. This is why Tux is formally known as the Linux mascot and not the logo.</p>
        <p>Tux was created by Larry Ewing using the first publicly released version (0.54) of GIMP, a free software graphics package. It was released by him under the following condition:
