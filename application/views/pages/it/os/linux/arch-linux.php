        <p><strong>Arch Linux</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux distribution', 'LIN'); ?> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('i686', 'CPU'); ?> and x86-64 computers. It is composed predominantly of free and open-source software, and supports community involvement.</p>
        <p>The design approach of the development team focuses on elegance, code correctness, minimalism, and simplicity, and expects the user to be willing to make some effort to understand the system's operation. The general guideline is always the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('KISS principle', 'PM'); ?> ("Keep it simple, stupid").
