        <p><strong>OS/2</strong> is a series of computer operating systems, initially created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>, then later developed by IBM exclusively. The name stands for "<em>Operating System/2</em>", because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's "<strong>Personal System/2</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PS/2', 'ITH'); ?>)" line of second-generation personal computers. The first version was released in December 1987 and newer versions were released until December 2001.</p>
        <p>OS/2 was intended as a protected mode successor of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC DOS', 'DOS'); ?>. Notably, basic system calls were modeled after <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'DOS'); ?> calls; their names even started with "Dos" and it was possible to create "Family Mode" applications: text mode applications that could work on both systems.</p>
        <p>OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006. It has been since maintained with relatively few new features under the name of <strong>eComStation</strong>.</p>
