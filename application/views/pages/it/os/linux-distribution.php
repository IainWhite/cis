        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Linux Distribution'); ?>
        <p>A <strong>Linux distribution</strong> (often called a <strong>distro</strong> for short) is an operating system made as a software collection based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux kernel', 'OS'); ?> and, often, on a package management system. Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers to powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).</p>
        <p>A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most common being the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('X Window System', 'IT'); ?>), a window manager, and a desktop environment. Most of the included software is free and open-source software made available both as compiled binaries and in source code form, allowing modifications to the original software. Usually, Linux distributions optionally include some proprietary software that may not be available in source code form, such as binary blobs required for some device drivers. Almost all Linux distributions are <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix-like', 'OS'); ?>; the most notable exception is <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>, which does not include a command-line interface and programs made for typical Linux distributions.</p>
        <p>A Linux distribution may also be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged together with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet the needs of many users. The software is usually adapted to the distribution and then packaged into software packages by the distribution's maintainers. The software packages are available online in so-called repositories, which are storage locations usually distributed around the world. Beside glue components, such as the distribution installers (for example, Debian Installer and Anaconda) or the package management systems, there are only very few packages that are originally written from the ground up by the maintainers of a Linux distribution.</p>
        <p>More than six hundred Linux distributions exist; over three hundred of those are in active development, constantly being revised and improved. Because of the huge availability of software, distributions have taken a wide variety of forms, including those suitable for use on desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones and tablets, as well as minimal environments typically for use in embedded systems. There are commercially backed distributions, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Fedora', 'LIN'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Red Hat', 'LIN'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('openSUSE', 'LIN'); ?> (SUSE) and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ubuntu', 'LIN'); ?> (Canonical Ltd.), and entirely community driven distributions, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Debian', 'LIN'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Slackware', 'LIN'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Gentoo', 'LIN'); ?> and [Arch Linux]<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Arch Linux', 'LIN'); ?>. Most distributions come ready to use and pre-compiled for a specific instruction set, while some distributions (such as Gentoo) are distributed mostly in source code form and compiled locally during installation.</p>
