        <p><strong>GEOS</strong> is a computer operating environment, graphical user interface, and suite of application software.</p>
        <p>Originally released as <strong>PC/GEOS</strong>, it runs on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> based, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatible', 'PC'); ?> computers.</p>
        <p>The package later became <strong>GeoWorks Ensemble</strong>, then <strong>NewDeal Office</strong>, and is now <strong>Breadbox Ensemble</strong>.</p>
        <p>Versions for some handheld platforms were also released.</p>
        <p>PC/GEOS was first created by <strong>Berkeley Softworks</strong>, who later became <strong>GeoWorks Corporation</strong>. Version 4.0 was developed in 2001 by Breadbox Computer Company, LLC, and named Breadbox Ensemble.</p>
        <p>PC/GEOS should not be confused with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8-bit', 'IT'); ?> GEOS product from the same company, which runs on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Commodore 64', 'ITH'); ?> and other computers using MOS <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MOS 6502', 'CPU'); ?> compatible microprocessors.</p>

            <h2>GeoWorks Ensemble</h2>
            <p>In 1990, GeoWorks released GEOS for IBM PC compatible systems, PC/GEOS.</p>
            <p>Also called GeoWorks Ensemble, it was incompatible with the earlier 8-bit versions of GEOS for Commodore and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple II', 'ITH'); ?> computers, but provided numerous enhancements, including scalable fonts and multitasking even on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XT', 'PC'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AT', 'PC'); ?> class PC clones.</p>
            <p>GeoWorks saw a market opportunity to provide a graphical user interface for the 16 million older model PCs that were unable to run <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows 2', 'WIN'); ?>.</p>
            <p>GEOS was packaged with a suite of productivity applications.</p>
            <p>Each had a name prefixed by "Geo": <strong>GeoWrite</strong>, <strong>GeoDraw</strong>; <strong>GeoManager</strong>; <strong>GeoPlanner</strong>; <strong>GeoDex</strong>, and <strong>GeoComm</strong>.</p>
            <p>It was also bundled with numerous PCs at the time, but like other <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?> environments for the PC platform, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GEM', 'OS'); ?>, it ultimately proved less successful in the marketplace than <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
            <p>Former CEO of GeoWorks claims that GEOS faded away because <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> threatened to withdraw supply of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'DOS'); ?> to hardware manufacturers who bundled Geoworks with their machines.</p>
            <p>Even though PC/GEOS is referred to as an "operating system", it still requires <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> software in order to load.</p>
            <p>GEOS and its applications were written in a mix of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('8086', 'CPU'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('assembly language', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?>.</p>

            <h2>PEN/GEOS</h2>
            <p>PEN/GEOS 1.0 was the new name for PC/GEOS 2.0 when GeoWorks released it on 9 April 1992.</p>
            <p>PEN/GEOS 2.0 was released in 1992, and version 3.0 was released in 1995.</p>

            <p>This phone uses PEN/GEOS 3.0 and established the smartphone market.</p>
