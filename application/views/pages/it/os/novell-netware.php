        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Novell NetWare'); ?>
        <p><strong>NetWare</strong> is a computer network operating system developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Novell Inc', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It initially used cooperative multitasking to run various services on a personal computer, with network protocols based on the archetypal <strong>Xerox Network Systems</strong> stack.</p>
        <p>Novell was acquired by <strong>The Attachmate Group</strong> in 2011, and now is a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>
        <p>The original NetWare product in 1983 supported clients running both <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'OS'); ?>, ran over a proprietary star network topology and was based on a Novell built file server using the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola 68000', 'CPU'); ?> processor.</p>
        <p>The company soon moved away from building its own hardware, and NetWare became hardware independent, running on any suitable <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel', 'C'); ?> based <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatible', 'ITH'); ?> system, and a wide range of network cards.</p>
        <p>From the beginning NetWare implemented a number of features inspired by mainframe and minicomputer systems that were not available in its competitors.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990s, Novell introduced separate cheaper networking products, unrelated to classic NetWare.</p>
        <p>These were <strong>NetWare Lite 1.0 (NWL)</strong>, and later <strong>Personal NetWare 1.0 (PNW)</strong> in 1993.</p>
        <p>In 1993 the main product line took a dramatic turn when Version 4 introduced <strong>NetWare Directory Services (NDS)</strong>, a global directory service to which <strong>Microsoft's Active Directory</strong>, released seven years later, was similar.</p>
        <p>This, along with a new <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('e-mail', 'WD'); ?> system, <strong>GroupWise</strong>, application configuration suite <strong>ZENworks</strong>, and security product <strong>BorderManager</strong> were all targeted at the needs of large enterprises.</p>
        <p>By 2000 however, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> was making increasing inroads into Novell's customer base and Novell increasingly looked to a future based on a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux kernel', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The successor product to NetWare, <strong>Open Enterprise Server</strong>, was released in March 2005. OES offers all the services previously hosted by NetWare v6.5, and added the choice of delivering those services using either a NetWare v6.5 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v9 kernel.</p>
