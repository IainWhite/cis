        <p><strong>CP/M-86</strong> was a version of the <strong>CP/M</strong> operating system that <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Research', 'C'); ?> made for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8086', 'CPU'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel 8088', 'CPU'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The commands are those of CP/M-80. Executable files used the relocatable <code>.CMD</code> file format.</p>
        <p>Digital Research also produced a multi-user multitasking operating system compatible with CP/M-86, MP/M-86, which later evolved into Concurrent CP/M-86. When an emulator was added to provide <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC-DOS', 'DOS'); ?> compatibility, the system was renamed to <strong>Concurrent DOS</strong>, which later became <strong>Multiuser DOS</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>DOS Plus</strong>, <strong>FlexOS</strong> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DR-DOS', 'DOS'); ?> families of operating systems started as derivations of Concurrent DOS.</p>
