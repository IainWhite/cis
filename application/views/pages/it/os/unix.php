        <p><strong>Unix</strong> is a multitasking, multi-user computer operating system that exists in many variants. The original Unix was developed at AT&amp;T's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bell Lab', 'C'); ?> research center by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ken Thompson', 'P'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Dennis Ritchie', 'P'); ?>, and others. From the power user's or programmer's perspective, Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy, meaning that OS provides a set of simple tools that each perform a limited, well-defined function, with a unified filesystem as the main means of communication and a shell scripting and command language to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.</p>
