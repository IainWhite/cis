        <p><strong>OS X Server</strong>, formerly <strong>Mac OS X Server</strong>, was a separately sold <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> server <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Operating System', 'IT'); ?> from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?> architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> with additional server programs and management and administration tools.</p>
        <p>As of version 10.7 (Lion), Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server were combined into one release and re-branded as OS X. A separate "server" operating system is no longer sold; the server-specific server applications and work group management and administration software tools from Mac OS X Server are now offered as OS X Server, an add-on package for OS X sold through the Mac App Store along with Workgroup Manager 10.8, available from the Apple support web site.</p>
        <p>These tools simplify access to key network services, including a mail transfer agent, AFP and SMB servers, an LDAP server, a domain name server, and others. Also included (particularly in later versions) are numerous additional services and the tools to manage them, such as web server, wiki server, chat server, calendar server, and many others.</p>

            <h2>Mac OS X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody)</h2>
            <p>The first version of Mac OS X was Mac OS X Server 1.0. Mac OS X Server 1.0 - 1.2v3 were based on Rhapsody, a hybrid of OPENSTEP from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NeXT Computer', 'C'); ?> and [Mac OS 8.5.1]. The GUI looked like a mixture of Mac OS 8's Platinum appearance with OPENSTEP's NeXT-based interface. It included a runtime layer called Blue Box for running legacy Mac OS-based applications within a separate window. There was discussion of implementing a 'transparent blue box' which would intermix Mac OS applications with those written for Rhapsody's Yellow Box environment, but this would not happen until Mac OS X's Classic environment. Apple File Services, Macintosh Manager, QuickTime Streaming Server, WebObjects and NetBoot were included with Mac OS X Server 1.0 - 1.2v3. It could not use FireWire devices.</p>

            <p>Released: 20 July 2011</p>
            <p>In releasing the developer preview of Mac OS X Lion in February 2011, Apple indicated that beginning with Lion, Mac OS X Server would be bundled with the operating system and would not be marketed as a separate product. However, a few months later, the company said it would instead sell the server components as a US$49.99 add-on to Lion, distributed through the Mac App Store (as well as Lion itself). The combined cost of an upgrade to Lion and the purchase of the OS X Server add-on, which costs approximately US$50, was nonetheless significantly lower than the retail cost of Snow Leopard Server (US$499).</p>
