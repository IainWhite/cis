        <p><strong>MS-DOS</strong>, short for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> Disk Operating System is an operating system for x86-based personal computers. It was the most commonly used member of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatible', 'ITH'); ?> personal computers during the 1980s to the mid-1990s, until it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?>), in particular by various generations of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> operating system.</p>
        <p>MS-DOS grew out of a request placed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> in 1981 for an operating system to use in its IBM PC range of personal computers. Microsoft quickly bought the rights to <strong>QDOS</strong> (<strong>Quick and Dirty Operating System</strong>), also known as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('86-DOS', 'DOS'); ?>, from <strong>Seattle Computer Products</strong>, and began work on modifying it to meet IBM's specification, who licensed and released it as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC DOS', 'DOS'); ?> 1.0 to be used with their PCs in August 1981. Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, years later the two products eventually went their separate ways.</p>

            <p>During its life, several competing products were released for the x86 platform and MS-DOS itself would go through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Ultimately it was the key product in Microsoft's growth from a programming languages company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. It is a flexible operating system, and consumes only 8MB of installation space.</p>
