        <p><strong>DR-DOS</strong> is an operating system of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> family, written for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC-compatible', 'ITH'); ?> personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M-86', 'OS'); ?>. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced as Novell DOS, Caldera OpenDOS, etc.</p>
