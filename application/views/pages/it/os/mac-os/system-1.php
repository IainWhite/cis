These releases can only run one application, except for desk accessories, at a time, though special application shells such as Servant, MultiMac, or Switcher (discussed under MultiFinder) could work around this. System 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a flat file system called Macintosh File System (MFS). The Finder provides virtual folders that could be used to organize files, but these are not visible from any other application and do not actually exist in the file system. System 2.0 added support for AppleTalk and the newly introduced LaserWriter to use it. System 2.1 (Finder 5.0) introduced the HFS (Hierarchical File System) which has real directories. This version was specifically to support the Hard Disk 20 and only implements HFS in RAM; startup and most floppy disks remain MFS 400K volumes. System 3.0 (Finder 5.1) was introduced with the Mac Plus, officially implementing HFS, 800K startup drives, support for several new technologies including SCSI and AppleShare, and Trash "bulging" (i.e., when the Trash contains files, it gains a bulged appearance). System 4.0 was released with the Mac SE and System 4.1 first shipped with the [Macintosh II] these new machines required additional support for the first expansion slots, the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), internal hard drives and, on the Mac II, lighter, colour, larger displays and the first Motorola 68020 processor.</p>
        <p>Changes in early <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> operating systems are best reflected in the version number of the Finder, where major leaps are found between 1.x, 4.x, 5.x, and 6.x.</p>
