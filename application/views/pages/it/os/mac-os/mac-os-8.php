        <p><strong>Mac OS 8</strong> is an operating system that was released by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Computer', 'C'); ?> on 26 July 1997. It represented the largest overhaul of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?> since the release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('System 7', 'MAC'); ?>, some six years previously. It puts more emphasis on color than previous operating systems. Released over a series of updates, Mac OS 8 was an effort to integrate many of the technologies developed for Apple's overly ambitious operating system known as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Copland', 'MAC'); ?>. Mac OS 8 helped modernize the Mac OS while Apple developed its next generation operating system, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>. Mac OS 8 is one of Apple's most successful software releases, selling over 1.2 million copies in the first two weeks. Coming as it did at a difficult time in Apple's history, many pirate groups refused to traffic in the new operating system, encouraging people to buy it instead.</p>
        <p>Mac OS 8.0 brought about the most visible changes in the line-up, including the introduction of the <strong>Platinum</strong> interface and a native <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PowerPC', 'CPU'); ?> multi-threaded Finder. Mac OS 8.1 introduced a new, more efficient file system known as HFS Plus. Mac OS 8.5 was the first version of the Mac OS to require a PowerPC processor. It featured PowerPC native versions of QuickDraw and AppleScript, along with the Sherlock search utility. Its successor, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS 9', 'MAC'); ?>, was released on 23 October 1999.</p>
