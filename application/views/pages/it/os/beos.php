        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('BeOS'); ?>
        <p><strong>BeOS</strong> is an operating system for personal computers first developed by <strong>Be Inc</strong> in 1991.</p>
        <p>It was first written to run on <strong>BeBox</strong> hardware.</p>
        <p>BeOS was built for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as symmetric multiprocessing by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, preemptive multitasking and a 64-bit journaling file system known as BFS.</p>
        <p>The BeOS <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?> was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.</p>
        <p>BeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform which could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?>  and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>However, it was ultimately unable to achieve a significant market share and proved commercially unviable for Be Inc.</p>
