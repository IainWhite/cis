        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Chrome OS'); ?>
        <p><strong>Chrome OS</strong> is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('operating system', 'IT'); ?> based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> kernel and designed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> to work with web applications and installed applications. Initially, Chrome OS was almost a pure web thin client operating system, with only a handful of "native" applications, but Google gradually began encouraging developers to create "packaged applications", some of which can work offline. In 2014, Google upgraded its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Play Store', 'MD'); ?> standards for packaged applications, requiring that these applications work offline. Around the same time, Google also announced that Chrome OS would gain the ability to run <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> applications natively, by late 2014. In September 2014, App Runtime for Chrome (beta) was launched together with four Android applications being able to run on Chrome OS.</p>
        <p>Chrome OS is built upon the open source project called <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chromium OS', 'OS'); ?> which, unlike Chrome OS, can be compiled from the downloaded source code. Chrome OS is the commercial version installed on specific hardware from Google's manufacturing partners. The launch date for retail hardware featuring Chrome OS was delayed from late 2010 to 15 June 2011, when "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chromebooks', 'ITH'); ?>" from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Samsung', 'C'); ?>, and then <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Acer', 'C'); ?> shipped in July.</p>
