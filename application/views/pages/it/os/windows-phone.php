        <p><strong>Windows Phone</strong> is a family of mobile operating systems developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> for smartphones as the replacement successor to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Mobile', 'OS'); ?>. Windows Phone features a new user interface derived from Metro design language. Unlike Windows Mobile, it is primarily aimed at the consumer market rather than the enterprise market. It was first launched in October 2010 with Windows Phone 7. Windows Phone 8.1 is the latest public release of the operating system, released to manufacturing on 14 April 2014.</p>
        <p>Windows 10 Mobile will succeed Windows Phone 8.1 in 2015; it emphasises a larger amount of integration and unification with its PC counterpart including a new, unified application ecosystem, along with an expansion of its scope to include small screened tablets.</p>
