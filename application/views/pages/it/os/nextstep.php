        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('NeXTSTEP'); ?>
        <p><strong>NeXTSTEP</strong> is an object-oriented, multitasking operating system which was developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('NeXT Inc', 'C'); ?> to run on its range of proprietary workstation computers, such as the <strong>NeXTcube</strong>. It was later ported to several other computer architectures.</p>
        <p>NeXTSTEP was later modified to separate the underlying operating system from the higher-level object libraries.</p>
        <p>The result was the <strong>OpenStep API</strong>, which ran on multiple underlying operating systems, including NeXT's own OPENSTEP.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple', 'C'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> are direct descendants of NeXTSTEP, through the OPENSTEP lineage.</p>
