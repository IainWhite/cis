        <p><strong>Windows Embedded Compact</strong>, formerly <strong>Windows Embedded CE</strong> and <strong>Windows CE</strong>, is an operating system subfamily developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> as part of its Windows Embedded family of products. Unlike Windows Embedded Standard, which is based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT', 'WIN'); ?>, Windows Embedded Compact uses an exclusive hybrid kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to original equipment manufacturers (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OEM', 'IT'); ?>s), who can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, with Windows CE providing the technical foundation to do so.</p>
