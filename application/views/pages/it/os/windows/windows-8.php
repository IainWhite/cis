        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('MS Windows 8'); ?>
        <p><strong>Windows 8</strong> is a personal computer operating system developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> as part of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT', 'WIN'); ?> family of operating systems.</p>
        <p>Windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system's platform and user interface to improve its user experience on tablets, where Windows was now competing with mobile operating systems, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?>. In particular, these changes included a touch optimized Windows shell based on Microsoft's "<strong>Metro</strong>" design language, the Start screen (which displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles), a new platform for developing apps with an emphasis on touchscreen input, integration with online services, and <strong>Windows Store</strong>, an online store for downloading and purchasing new software.</p>
