        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('MS Windows 95'); ?>
        <p><strong>Windows 95</strong> is a graphical user interface-based operating system. It was released on 24 August 1995 by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>. During development, it was referred to as <strong>Windows 4.0</strong> or by the internal codename "<strong><em>Chicago</em></strong>".</p>
        <p>Windows 95 integrated Microsoft's formerly separate <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'DOS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> products. It featured significant improvements over its predecessor, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 3', 'WIN'); ?>, most notably in the Graphical User Interface (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?>) and in its relatively simplified "<em>plug-n-play</em>" features. There were also major changes made at lower levels of the operating system, such as moving from a mainly <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('16-bit', 'IT'); ?> architecture to a pre-emptively multitasked <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('32-bit', 'IT'); ?> architecture.</p>
        <p>Some three years after its introduction, Windows 95 was succeeded by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 98', 'WIN'); ?>. Support for Windows 95 ended on 31 December 2001.</p>

            <h2>Windows 95 Plus!</h2>
            <p><strong>Plus!</strong> was a commercial operating system enhancement product by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
            <p>Windows 95 Plus! included <strong>Space Cadet Pinball</strong>, the <strong>Internet Jumpstart Kit</strong> (which was the introduction of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WD'); ?>), <strong>DriveSpace 3</strong> and <strong>Compression Agent</strong> disk compression utilities, the initial release of theme support along with a set of 12 themes, dial-up networking server, dial-up scripting tool, and the graphical improvements such as anti-aliased screen fonts, full-window drag, the ability to stretch or shrink the wallpaper to fit the screen and highcolor icons.</p>
            <p>Task Scheduler as it is present in later Windows versions was included as System Agent.</p>
            <p>A utility to notify the user of low disk space (<code>DiskAlm.exe</code>) also ran as part of System Agent.</p>
            <p>Plus! for Windows 95 was initially marketed for adding features for high-performance computers so Windows 95 could meet the minimum system requirement of an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('80386', 'CPU'); ?> CPU with 8 megabytes of RAM.</p>
            <p>Later releases of Windows 95 (OSR2 and onwards) included DriveSpace 3 and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer 3', 'IE'); ?>.</p>
            <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 98', 'WIN'); ?> included all of the enhancements included in Plus! for Windows 95. The Pinball game was not installed by default, but included on the Windows 98 CD.</p>
