        <p><strong>Windows 2000</strong> is an operating system for use on both client and server computers. It was produced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> and launched to retail on 17 February 2000. It is the successor to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT 4.0', 'WIS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Windows 2000 did not have a codename because, according to <strong>Dave Thompson</strong> of Windows NT team, "<em>Jim Allchin didn't like codenames</em>". Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 was codenamed "<strong><em>Asteroid</em></strong>" and Windows 2000 <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('64-bit', 'IT'); ?> was codenamed "<strong><em>Janus</em></strong>".</p>
