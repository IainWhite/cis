        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Wi-Fi'); ?>
        <p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, also written as <strong>Wifi</strong> or <strong>WiFi</strong>, is a local area wireless technology that allows an electronic device to exchange data or connect to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?> using 2.4 GHz UHF and 5 GHz SHF radio waves.</p>
        <p>The name is a trademark name, and is a play on the audiophile term Hi-Fi.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi Alliance', 'C'); ?> defines Wi-Fi as any "<em>wireless local area network (<strong>WLAN</strong>) products that are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IEEE', 'C'); ?>) 802.11 standards</em>".</p>
        <p>However, since most modern WLANs are based on these standards, the term "<em>Wi-Fi</em>" is used in general English as a synonym for "<em>WLAN</em>".</p>
        <p>Only Wi-Fi products that complete Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certification testing successfully may use the "<em>Wi-Fi CERTIFIED</em>" trademark.</p>
        <p>Many devices can use Wi-Fi, e.g. personal computers, video-game consoles, smartphones, some digital cameras, tablet computers and digital audio players.</p>
        <p>These can connect to a network resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access point.</p>
        <p>Such an access point (or <em>hotspot</em>) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors.</p>
        <p>Hotspot coverage can comprise an area as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.</p>
        <p>Wi-Fi can be less secure than wired connections (such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ethernet', 'ITN'); ?>) because an intruder does not need a physical connection.</p>
        <p>Web pages that use <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SSL', 'IPA'); ?> are secure but unencrypted Internet access can easily be detected by intruders. Because of this, Wi-Fi has adopted various encryption technologies.</p>
        <p>The early encryption <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WEP', 'ITN'); ?>, proved easy to break. Higher quality protocols (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WPA', 'ITN'); ?>, WPA2) were added later.</p>
        <p>An optional feature added in 2007, called Wi-Fi Protected Setup (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WPS', 'ITN'); ?>), had a serious flaw that allowed an attacker to recover the router's password.</p>
        <p>The Wi-Fi Alliance has since updated its test plan and certification program to ensure all newly certified devices resist attacks.</p>
