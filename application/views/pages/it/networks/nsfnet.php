        <p><strong>The National Science Foundation Network</strong> (<strong>NSFNET</strong>) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the <strong>National Science Foundation</strong> (<strong>NSF</strong>) beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States.</p>
        <p>NSFNET was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks that were constructed to support NSF's networking initiatives from 1985 - 1995.</p>
        <p>Initially created to link researchers to the nation's NSF funded supercomputing centers, through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?> backbone.</p>
        <p>Following the deployment of the <strong>Computer Science Network (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSNET', 'ITN'); ?>)</strong>, a network that provided Internet services to academic computer science departments, in 1981, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) aimed to create an academic research network facilitating access by researchers to the supercomputing centres funded by NSF in the United States.</p>
        <p>In 1985, NSF began funding the creation of five new supercomputing centres:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>John von Neumann Center at Princeton University</li>
            <li>San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) on the campus of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</li>
            <li>National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</li>
            <li>Cornell Theory Center at Cornell University</li>
            <li>Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), a joint effort of Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Westinghouse</li>
        </ol>
        <p>NSFNET was to be a general-purpose research network, a hub to connect the five supercomputing centres along with the NSF-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to each other and to the regional research and education networks that would in turn connect campus networks.</p>
        <p>Using this three tier network architecture NSFNET would provide access between the supercomputer centres and other sites over the backbone network at no cost to the centres or to the regional networks using the open <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TCP/IP', 'ITN'); ?> protocols initially deployed successfully on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ARPANET', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
