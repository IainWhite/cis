        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Ethernet'); ?>
        <p><strong>Ethernet</strong> is a family of computer networking technologies for <strong>Local Area Networks (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('LAN', 'ITN'); ?>s)</strong>.</p>
        <p>Ethernet was commercially introduced in 1980 and standardized in 1983 as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IEEE', 'C'); ?> 802.3.</p>
        <p>Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('token ring', 'ITN'); ?>, FDDI, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ARCNET', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The Ethernet standards comprise several wiring and signalling variants of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OSI', 'ITN'); ?> physical layer in use with Ethernet.</p>
        <p>The original <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('10BASE5', 'ITN'); ?> Ethernet used coaxial cable as a shared medium.</p>
        <p>Later the coaxial cables were replaced with twisted pair and fibre optic links in conjunction with hubs or switches.</p>
        <p>Data rates were periodically increased from the original 10 megabits per second to 100 gigabits per second.</p>
        <p>Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called frames.</p>
        <p>Each frame contains source and destination addresses and error checking data so that damaged data can be detected and re-transmitted.</p>
        <p>As per the OSI model, Ethernet provides services up to and including the data link layer.</p>
        <p>Since its commercial release, Ethernet has retained a good degree of compatibility.</p>
        <p>Features such as the 48-bit MAC address and Ethernet frame format have influenced other networking protocols.</p>
