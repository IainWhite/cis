        <p><strong>Pathworks</strong> was the tradename used by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Equipment Corporation', 'C'); ?> for a series of programs that eased the interoperation of Digital's minicomputers with personal computers. It was available for both <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac', 'ITH'); ?> computer systems.</p>
        <p>The server part of Pathworks ran on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VAX/VMS', 'OS'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ultrix', 'OS'); ?> and enabled a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC VAX', 'ITH'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VAXcluster', 'ITN'); ?> to act as a file and print server for client <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC compatible', 'ITH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITHW'); ?> workstations. Pathworks server was derived from <strong>LanMan/X</strong>, the portable version of <strong>OS/2 LAN Manager</strong>.</p>
        <p>Once installed onto the PCs, the Pathworks client provided the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DECnet end-node connectivity with the host systems</li>
            <li>PowerTerm 525 Terminal emulation software from Ericom</li>
            <li>File-transfer software</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For clients running a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?> such as [Windows 3.x]<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 3.x', 'WIN'); ?>, additional components available included an X window system server, allowing clients to access graphical apps running on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VMS', 'OS'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UNIX', 'OS'); ?> hosts, and clients for DEC's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ALL-IN-1', 'ITS'); ?> email and groupware system. Although primitive by modern standards, Pathworks was very sophisticated for its time; far more than just a file and print server, it made client microcomputers into terminals and workstations on a DEC network.</p>
