        <p><strong>DECnet</strong> is a suite of network protocols created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Digital Equipment Corporation', 'C'); ?>, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OSI model', 'ITN'); ?> compliant networking protocol.</p>
        <p>DECnet was built right into the DEC flagship operating system <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VMS', 'OS'); ?> since its inception. Later Digital ported it to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ultrix', 'OS'); ?>, as well as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Macintosh', 'ITNH'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM PC', 'ITNH'); ?> running variants of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> under the name <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC Pathworks', 'ITN'); ?>, allowing these systems to connect to DECnet networks of VAX machines as terminal nodes. More recently, an open-source version has been developed for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GNU/Linux', 'LIN'); ?>. DECnet code in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux kernel', 'OS'); ?> was marked as orphaned on 18 February 2010.</p>
