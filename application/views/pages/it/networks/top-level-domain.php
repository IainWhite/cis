        <p>A <strong>top-level domain (TLD)</strong> is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Domain Name System', 'IPA'); ?> of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?>. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last label of a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('fully qualified domain name', 'ITN'); ?>. For example, in the domain name <code>www.example.com</code>, the top-level domain is <code>com</code>. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organisations by the <strong>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ICANN', 'C'); ?>)</strong>, which operates the <strong>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IANA', 'C'); ?>)</strong>, and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.</p>
