        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol'); ?>
        <p><strong>Remote Desktop Protocol</strong> (<strong>RDP</strong>) is a proprietary protocol developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.</p>
        <p>The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.</p>
        <p>Clients exist for most versions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> (including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Mobile', 'OS'); ?>), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>, and other modern operating systems.</p>
        <p>RDP servers are built into Windows operating systems; an RDP server for Unix and OS X also exists.</p>
        <p>By default, the server listens on TCP port 3389 and UDP port 3389.</p>
        <p>Microsoft currently refers to their official RDP server software as <strong>Remote Desktop Connection</strong>, formerly "<strong>Terminal Services Client</strong>".</p>
