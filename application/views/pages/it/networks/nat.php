        <p><strong>Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong> is a methodology of remapping one <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IP address', 'IP'); ?> space into another by modifying network address information in <strong>Internet Protocol (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IP', 'IP'); ?>)</strong> datagram packet headers while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The technique was originally used for ease of rerouting traffic in IP networks without renumbering every host. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space allocations in face of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IPv4 address exhaustion', 'IP'); ?>.</p>
