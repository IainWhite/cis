        <p><strong>Bonjour</strong> is <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>'s implementation of Zero-configuration networking (Zeroconf), a group of technologies that includes service discovery, address assignment, and hostname resolution. Bonjour locates devices such as printers, other computers, and the services that those devices offer on a local network using multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) service records.</p>
        <p>The software comes built-in with Apple's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> operating systems. Bonjour can also be installed onto computers running <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?>. Bonjour components may also be included within other software such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iTunes', 'URL'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari', 'WB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>After its introduction in 2002 with Mac OS X v10.2 as <strong>Rendezvous</strong>, the software was renamed in 2005 to Bonjour following an out-of-court trademark dispute settlement.</p>
