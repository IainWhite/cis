        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('ARPANET - Advanced Research Projects Agency Network'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Advanced Research Projects Agency Network</strong> (<strong>ARPANET</strong>) was one of the world's first operational packet switching networks, the first network to implement <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TCP/IP', 'ITN'); ?>, and the progenitor of what was to become the global <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The network was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) within the U.S. Department of Defense for use by its projects at universities and research laboratories in the US.</p>
        <p>The packet switching of the ARPANET, together with TCP/IP, would form the backbone of how the Internet works.</p>
        <p>The packet switching was based on concepts and designs by American engineer Paul Baran, British scientist Donald Davies and Lawrence Roberts of the Lincoln Laboratory.</p>
        <p>The TCP/IP communication protocols were developed for ARPANET by computer scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf, and also incorporated some designs from Louis Pouzin.</p>
