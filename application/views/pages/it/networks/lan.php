        <p>A <strong>Local Area Network</strong> (<strong>LAN</strong>) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building using network media.</p>
        <p>The defining characteristics of LANs, in contrast to <strong>Wide Area Networks (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WAN', 'ITN'); ?>s)</strong>, include their smaller geographic area, and non-inclusion of leased telecommunication lines.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ARCNET', 'ITN'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Token Ring', 'ITN'); ?> and other technology standards have been used in the past, but <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ethernet', 'ITH'); ?> over twisted pair cabling, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi', 'ITH'); ?> are the two most common technologies currently used to build LANs.</p>
