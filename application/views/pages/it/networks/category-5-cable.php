        <p><strong>Category 5 cable</strong> (<strong>Cat 5</strong>) is a twisted pair cable for carrying signals.</p>
        <p>This type of cable is used in structured cabling for computer networks such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ethernet', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The cable standard provides performance of up to 100 MHz and is suitable for 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX (<strong>Fast Ethernet</strong>), and 1000BASE-T (<strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong>).</p>
        <p>Cat 5 is also used to carry other signals such as telephony and video.</p>
        <p>This cable is commonly connected using punch-down blocks and modular connectors.</p>
        <p>Most Category 5 cables are unshielded, relying on the balanced line twisted pair design and differential signalling for noise rejection.</p>
