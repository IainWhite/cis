        <p>Networks in which certain computers have special dedicated tasks, providing services to other computers (in the network) are called <strong>client-server</strong> networks.</p>
        <p>The client–server model of computing is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.</p>
        <p>Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system.</p>
        <p>A server host runs one or more server programs which share their resources with clients.</p>
        <p>A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function.</p>
        <p>Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests.</p>
        <p>Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('email', 'WD'); ?>, network printing, and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
