        <p>An <strong>intranet</strong> is a computer network that uses <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Protocol', 'ITN'); ?> technology to share information, operational systems, or computing services within an organization.</p>
        <p>This term is used in contrast to extranet, a network between organizations, and instead refers to a network within an organization.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the term refers only to the organization's internal website, but may be a more extensive part of the organization's information technology infrastructure, and may be composed of multiple local area networks.</p>
        <p>The objective is to organize each individual's desktop with minimal cost, time and effort to be more productive, cost efficient, timely, and competitive.</p>
        <p>An intranet may host multiple private websites and constitute an important component and focal point of internal communication and collaboration.</p>
