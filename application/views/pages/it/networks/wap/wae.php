        <p><strong>Wireless Application Environment (WAE)</strong> follows an architecture that’s more complicated than the WWW model because it needs to address the specific limitations of wireless devices. The cellular phone community is made up of a series of private networks. Because cellular phone providers maintain a partnership with a discrete network, each phone complies with the standards of only one network and there’s limited synergy among the networks. WAE defines <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WAP', 'ITN'); ?> as a public, standard protocol. Wireless devices communicate via WAP in addition to the pre-existing protocols supplied by private networks.</p>
