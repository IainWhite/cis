        <p>A <strong>hostname</strong> is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('e-mail', 'WD'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Usenet', 'WD'); ?>. Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured.</p>
        <p>On the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?>, hostnames may have appended the name of a <strong>Domain Name System (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DNS', 'IPA'); ?>)</strong> domain, separated from the host specific label by a period ("dot"). In the latter form, a hostname is also called a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('domain name', 'ITN'); ?>. If the domain name is completely specified, including a top-level domain of the Internet, then the hostname is said to be a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('fully qualified domain name', 'ITN'); ?> (FQDN). Hostnames that include DNS domains are often stored in the Domain Name System together with the IP addresses of the host they represent for the purpose of mapping the hostname to an address, or the reverse process.</p>
