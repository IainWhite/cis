        <p>A <strong>Wide Area Network</strong> (<strong>WAN</strong>) is a network that covers a broad area (i.e., any telecommunications network that links across metropolitan, regional, national or international boundaries) using leased telecommunication lines.</p>
        <p>Business and government entities utilize WANs to relay data among employees, clients, buyers, and suppliers from various geographical locations.</p>
        <p>In essence, this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?> can be considered a WAN as well, and is used by businesses, governments, organizations, and individuals for almost any purpose imaginable.</p>
        <p>Related terms for other types of networks are <strong>Personal Area Networks (PANs)</strong>, <strong>Local Area Networks (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('LAN', 'ITN'); ?>s)</strong>, <strong>Campus Area Networks (CANs)</strong>, or <strong>Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)</strong> which are usually limited to a room, building, campus or specific metropolitan area (e.g., a city) respectively.</p>
