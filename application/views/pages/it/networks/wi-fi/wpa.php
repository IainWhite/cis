        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('WPA - Wi-Fi Protected Access'); ?>
        <p><strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access</strong> (<strong>WPA</strong>) and <strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access II</strong> (<strong>WPA2</strong>) are two security protocols and security certification programs developed by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Wi-Fi Alliance', 'C'); ?>  to secure wireless computer networks.</p>
        <p>The Alliance defined these in response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in the previous system, <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WEP', 'ITN'); ?>  (Wired Equivalent Privacy)</strong>.</p>
        <p>WPA (sometimes referred to as the draft <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IEEE', 'C'); ?> 802.11i standard) became available in 2003.</p>
        <p>The Wi-Fi Alliance intended it as an intermediate measure in anticipation of the availability of the more secure and complex WPA2.</p>
        <p>WPA2 became available in 2004 and is a common shorthand for the full IEEE 802.11i (or IEEE 802.11i-2004) standard.</p>
        <p>A flaw in a feature added to Wi-Fi, called <strong>Wi-Fi Protected Set-up (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WPS', 'ITN'); ?> )</strong>, allows WPA and WPA2 security to be bypassed and effectively broken in many situations.</p>
        <p>WPA and WPA2 security implemented without using the Wi-Fi Protected Set-up feature are unaffected by the security vulnerability.</p>
