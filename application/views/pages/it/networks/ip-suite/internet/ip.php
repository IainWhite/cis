        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('IP - Internet Protocol'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>) is the principal communications protocol in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Protocol Suite', '/it/networks/internet-protocol-suite'); ?> for relaying datagrams across network boundaries.</p>
        <p>Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.</p>
        <p>IP, as the primary protocol in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Layer', '/it/networks/internet-protocol-suite'); ?> of the Internet protocol suite, has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers.</p>
        <p>For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered.</p>
        <p>It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.</p>
        <p>Historically, IP was the connectionless datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974; the other being the connection-oriented Transmission Control Protocol (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TCP', '/it/networks/internet-protocol-suite/transport'); ?>).</p>
        <p>The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TCP/IP', '/it/networks'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The first major version of IP, Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6).</p>
