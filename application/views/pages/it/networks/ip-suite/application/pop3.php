        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('POP - Post Office Protocol'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Post Office Protocol</strong> (<strong>POP</strong>) is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Application Layer', '/it/networks/internet-protocol-suite'); ?> Internet standard protocol used by local <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('email', 'WD'); ?> clients to retrieve email from a remote server over a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TCP/IP', '/it/networks/'); ?> connection.</p>
        <p>POP has been developed through several versions, with version 3 (<strong>POP3</strong>) being the current standard.</p>
        <p>Virtually all modern email clients and servers support POP3, and it along with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IMAP', '/it/networks/internet-protocol-suite/application'); ?> (<strong>Internet Message Access Protocol</strong>) are the two most prevalent Internet standard protocols for email retrieval, with many webmail service providers such as Gmail also providing support for either IMAP or POP3 to allow mail to be downloaded.</p>
