        <p>The <strong>Network News Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>NNTP</strong>) is an application protocol used for transporting Usenet news articles between news servers and for reading and posting articles by end user client applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Brian Kantor</strong> of the University of California, San Diego and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley authored <?php echo $this->stencil->addRFCLink('977'); ?>, the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March 1986.</p>
        <p>Usenet was originally designed based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UUCP', 'IT'); ?> network, with most article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone links between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems. Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles directly from the local disk.</p>
