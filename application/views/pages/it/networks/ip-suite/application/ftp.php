        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('FTP - File Transfer Protocol'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>FTP</strong>) is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files from one host to another host over a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TCP', 'IPT'); ?>-based network, such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>FTP is built on a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('client-server', 'ITN'); ?> architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.</p>
        <p>FTP users may authenticate themselves using a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it.</p>
        <p><strong>SSH File Transfer Protocol</strong> (SFTP) is sometimes also used instead, but is technologically different.</p>
        <p>The first FTP client applications were command-line applications developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> operating systems.</p>
        <p>Many FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications, such as web page editors.</p>
        <p>The original specification for the File Transfer Protocol was written by <strong>Abhay Bhushan</strong> and published as <?php echo $this->stencil->addRFCLink('114'); ?> on 16 April 1971. Until 1980, FTP ran on NCP, the predecessor of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TCP/IP', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
