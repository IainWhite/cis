        <p><strong>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</strong> is an application layer protocol that facilitates the transfer of messages in the form of text. The chat process works on a client / server networking model. IRC clients are computer programs that a user can install on their system. These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients. IRC is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one on one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.</p>
        <p>Client software is available for every major operating system that supports Internet access. As of April 2011, the top 100 IRC networks served more than half a million users at a time, with hundreds of thousands of channels operating on a total of roughly 1,500 servers out of roughly 3,200 servers worldwide.</p>
