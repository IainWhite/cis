        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('VPN - Virtual Private Network'); ?>
        <p>A <strong>Virtual Private Network</strong> (<strong>VPN</strong>) extends a private network across a public network, such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'ITN'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It enables a computer to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it is directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and management policies of the private network.</p>
        <p>A VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual tunnelling protocols, or traffic encryptions.</p>
        <p>Through VPN you can access your private network over Internet.</p>
        <p>A virtual private network connection across the Internet is similar to a <strong>Wide Area Network (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WAN', 'ITN'); ?>)</strong> link between sites.</p>
        <p>From a user perspective, the extended network resources are accessed in the same way as resources available within the private network.</p>
        <p>VPNs allow employees to securely access their company's internet while travelling outside the office.</p>
        <p>Similarly, VPNs securely connect geographically disparate offices of an organization, creating one cohesive network.</p>
        <p>VPN technology is also used by Internet users to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location.</p>
