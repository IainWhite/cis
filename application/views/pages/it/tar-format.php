        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('TAR Format'); ?>
        <p><strong>Tar</strong> (derived from <strong>t</strong>ape <strong>ar</strong>chive) is both a file format (in the form of a type of archive bitstream) and the name of a program used to handle such files.</p>
        <p>The format was created in the early days of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Initially developed to write data to sequential I/O devices for tape backup purposes, tar is now commonly used to collect many files into one larger file for distribution or archiving, while preserving file system information such as user and group permissions, dates, and directory structures.</p>
