        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('CLI - Command Line Interface'); ?>
        <p>A <strong>Command Line Interface</strong> (<strong>CLI</strong>), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface, and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).</p>
        <p>The CLI was the primary means of interaction with most computer systems until the introduction of the video display terminal in the mid 1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> systems and personal computer systems including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'DOS'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The interface is usually implemented with a command line shell, which is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands to appropriate operating system functions.</p>
        <p>Command-Line Interfaces to computer operating systems are less widely used by casual computer users, who favour <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Graphical User Interfaces', 'IT'); ?> (GUI).</p>
        <p>Command-Line Interfaces are often preferred by more advanced computer users, as they often provide a more concise and powerful means to control a program or operating system.</p>
        <p>Programs with Command-Line Interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting.</p>
