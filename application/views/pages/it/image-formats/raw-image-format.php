        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Raw Image Format'); ?>
        <p>A camera raw image file contains minimally processed data from the image sensor of either a digital camera, image scanner, or motion picture film scanner. Raw files are named so because they are not yet processed and therefore are not ready to be printed or edited with a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('bitmap graphics', 'IT'); ?> editor. Normally, the image is processed by a raw converter in a wide-gamut internal colourspace where precise adjustments can be made before conversion to a "positive" file format such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TIFF', 'IT'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JPEG', 'IT'); ?> for storage, printing, or further manipulation, which often encodes the image in a device dependent colourspace. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of raw formats in use by different models of digital equipment.</p>
