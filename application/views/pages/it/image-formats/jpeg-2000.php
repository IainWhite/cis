        <p><strong>JPEG 2000 (JP2)</strong> is an image compression standard and coding system. It was created by the <strong>Joint Photographic Experts Group</strong> committee in 2000 with the intention of superseding their original discrete cosine transform-based <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JPEG', 'IT'); ?> standard (created in 1992) with a newly designed, wavelet-based method. The standardised filename extension is <code>.jp2</code> for ISO/IEC 15444-1 conforming files and <code>.jpx</code> for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2. The registered <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MIME types', 'WD'); ?> are defined in <?php echo $this->stencil->addRFCLink('3745'); ?>. For ISO/IEC 15444-1 it is <code>image/jp2</code>.</p>
        <p>JPEG 2000 code streams are regions of interest that offer several mechanisms to support spatial random access or region of interest access at varying degrees of granularity. It is possible to store different parts of the same picture using different quality.</p>
