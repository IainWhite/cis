        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('BMP - Bitmap Image File'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>BMP</strong> file format, also known as <strong>bitmap image file</strong> or <strong>device independent bitmap (DIB)</strong> file format or simply a bitmap, is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('raster graphics', 'IT'); ?> image file format used to store bitmap digital images, independently of the display device, especially on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?> operating systems.</p>
        <p>The BMP file format is capable of storing two-dimensional digital images of arbitrary width, height, and resolution, both monochrome and colour, in various colour depths, and optionally with data compression, alpha channels, and color profiles. The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Metafile', 'IT'); ?> (WMF) specification covers the BMP file format.</p>
