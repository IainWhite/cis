        <p><strong>TIFF</strong> is a computer file format for storing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('raster graphics', 'IT'); ?> images, popular among graphic artists, the publishing industry, and both amateur and professional photographers in general. The format was originally created by the company <strong>Aldus</strong> for use in desktop publishing. When <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Systems', 'C'); ?> acquired Aldus, they published Version 6 (1992) of the TIFF specification.</p>
        <p>The TIFF format is widely supported by image manipulation applications, by publishing and page layout applications, and by scanning, faxing, word processing, optical character recognition and other applications. Adobe Systems, which acquired Aldus, now holds the copyright to the TIFF specification. TIFF has not had a major update since 1992, though several Aldus / Adobe technical notes have been published with minor extensions to the format, and several specifications, including TIFF/EP (ISO 12234-2), TIFF/IT (ISO 12639), TIFF-F (<?php echo $this->stencil->addRFCLink('2306'); ?>) and TIFF-FX (<?php echo $this->stencil->addRFCLink('3949'); ?>) have been based on the TIFF 6.0 specification.</p>
