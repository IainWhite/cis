        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('PNG - Portable Network Graphics'); ?>
        <p><strong>Portable Network Graphics (PNG)</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('raster graphics', 'IT'); ?> file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG was created as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GIF', 'IT'); ?>), and is the most used lossless image compression format on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet', 'IT'); ?>.</p>
        <p>PNG supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RGB', 'IT'); ?> or 32-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RGBA', 'IT'); ?> colours), grayscale images (with or without alpha channel), and full-colour non-palette-based RGB(A) images (with or without alpha channel). PNG was designed for transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics, and therefore does not support non-RGB color spaces such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CMYK', 'IT'); ?>.</p>
        <p>PNG files nearly always use file extension PNG or <code>png</code> and are assigned <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MIME media type', 'WD'); ?> <code>image/png</code>. PNG was approved for this use by the Internet Engineering Steering Group on 14 October 1996, and was published as an ISO/IEC standard in 2004.</p>
