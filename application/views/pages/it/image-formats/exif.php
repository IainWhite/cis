        <p><strong>Exchangeable image file</strong> format (officially <strong>Exif</strong>, according to JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA specifications) is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. The specification uses the following existing file formats with the addition of specific metadata tags: <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JPEG', 'IT'); ?> discrete cosine transform (DCT) for compressed image files, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('TIFF', 'IT'); ?> Rev. 6.0 (RGB or YCbCr) for uncompressed image files, and RIFF WAV for audio files (Linear PCM or ITU-T G.711 Î¼-Law PCM for uncompressed audio data, and IMA-ADPCM for compressed audio data).</p>
        <p>This standard consists of the Exif image file specification and the Exif audio file specification.</p>
