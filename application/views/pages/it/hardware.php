        <p><strong>Computer hardware</strong> is the collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer system.</p>
        <p>Computer hardware refers to the physical parts or components of a computer such as the monitor, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('mouse', 'ITH'); ?>, keyboard, computer data storage, hard drive disk (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HDD', 'ITH'); ?>), system unit (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('graphic cards', 'ITH'); ?>, memory, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('sound cards', 'ITH'); ?>, motherboard and chips), etc. all of which are physical objects that can be touched.</p>
        <p>In contrast, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('software', 'IT'); ?> is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware.</p>
        <p>Software is any set of machine readable instructions that directs a computer's processor to perform specific operations.</p>
        <p>A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system.</p>
