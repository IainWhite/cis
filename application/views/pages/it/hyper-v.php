        <p><strong>Hyper-V</strong>, codenamed <em>Viridian</em> and formerly known as <strong>Windows Server Virtualization</strong>, is a native hypervisor; it can create virtual machines on x86-64 systems. Starting with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 8', 'WIN'); ?>, Hyper-V supersedes <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Virtual PC', 'IT'); ?> as the hardware virtualisation component of the client editions of Windows NT. A server computer running Hyper-V can be configured to expose individual virtual machines to one or more networks.</p>
        <p>Hyper-V was first released alongside <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Server 2008', 'WIS'); ?> and has since become a staple of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Server', 'OS'); ?> family.</p>
