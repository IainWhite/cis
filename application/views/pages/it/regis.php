        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('ReGIS - Remote Graphic Instruction Set'); ?>
        <p><strong>ReGIS</strong>, short for <strong>Remote Graphic Instruction Set</strong>, was a vector graphics markup language developed by <strong>Digital Equipment Corporation (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC', 'C'); ?>)</strong> for later models of their famous VT series of computer terminals. ReGIS supported rudimentary vector graphics consisting of lines, circular arcs, and similar shapes. Terminals supporting ReGIS generally allowed graphics and text to be mixed on-screen, which made construction of graphs and charts relatively easy.</p>
        <p>ReGIS was first introduced on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VT125', 'VT'); ?> in July 1981, followed shortly thereafter by the <strong>VK100 "GIGI"</strong> which combined the VT125 display system with composite video output and a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BASIC', 'L'); ?> interpreter. Later versions of the VT series included ReGIS, often with color support as well. This included the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VT240', 'VT'); ?> and 241, VT330 and 340, and the VT525. ReGIS is also supported by a small number of terminal emulator systems.</p>
        <p>ReGIS replaced an earlier system known as waveform graphics that had been introduced on the VT55 and later used on the VT105. DEC normally provided backward compatibility with their terminals, but in this case the waveform system was simply dropped when ReGIS was introduced.</p>
