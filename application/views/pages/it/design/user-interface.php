        <p>The <strong>user interface</strong>, in the industrial design field of human–machine interaction, is the space where interaction between humans and machines occurs.</p>
        <p>The goal of this interaction is effective operation and control of the machine on the user's end, and feedback from the machine, which aids the operator in making operational decisions.</p>
        <p>Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls.</p>
        <p>The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.</p>
        <p>A user interface is the system by which people (users) interact with a machine.</p>
        <p>The user interface includes hardware (physical) and software (logical) components.</p>
        <p>User interfaces exist for various systems, and provide a means of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Input, allowing the users to manipulate a system</li>
            <li>Output, allowing the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Generally, the goal of human-machine interaction engineering is to produce a user interface which makes it easy (self exploratory), efficient, and enjoyable (user friendly) to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result.</p>
        <p>This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the human.</p>
        <p>With the increased use of personal computers and the relative decline in societal awareness of heavy machinery, the term user interface is generally assumed to mean the graphical user interface (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?>), while industrial control panel and machinery control design discussions more commonly refer to human-machine interfaces.</p>
        <p>Other terms for user interface include <strong>human–computer interface</strong> (<strong>HCI</strong>) and <strong>man–machine interface</strong> (<strong>MMI</strong>).</p>
