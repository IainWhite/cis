        <p><strong>FairPlay</strong> is a digital rights management (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DRM', 'IT'); ?>) technology created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?>, based on technology created by the company <strong>Veridisc</strong>. FairPlay is built into the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('QuickTime', 'ITS'); ?> multimedia software and used by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPhone', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPod', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iPad', 'ITH'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple TV', 'ITH'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iTunes Store', 'IT'); ?> and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('App Store', 'MD'); ?>. Formerly, all songs in the iTunes Store were encoded with FairPlay. Apple later started offering a selection of songs that, after an additional 30 cents is paid per song, could be downloaded FairPlay free. Apple no longer sells individual songs or albums with FairPlay encryption from the iTunes store. However, apps downloaded from the iTunes store and Apple Music subscription songs saved for offline listening are still encrypted with FairPlay. FairPlay digitally encrypts AAC audio files and prevents users from playing these files on unauthorised computers.</p>
        <p>The majority of FairPlay encrypted content is purchased through the iTunes Store, using the iTunes software. The iTunes software relies on Apple's Quicktime multimedia software for decoding and playback of the encrypted files. Every media player capable of using QuickTime is capable of playing back FairPlay encrypted files, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RealPlayer', 'ITS'); ?>, JRiver Media Center, Media Player Classic and Songbird.</p>
