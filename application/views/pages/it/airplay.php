        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('AirPlay'); ?>
        <p><strong>AirPlay</strong> is a proprietary protocol stack / suite developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?> that allows wireless streaming between devices of audio, video, device screens, and photos, together with related metadata. Originally implemented only in Apple's software and devices, it was called AirTunes and used for audio only. Apple has since licensed the AirPlay protocol stack as a third-party software component technology to manufacturer partners for them to use in their products in order to be compatible with Apple's devices.</p>
