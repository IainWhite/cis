        <p>The <strong>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</strong> (<strong>ASCII</strong>) is a character encoding scheme originally based on the English alphabet that encodes 128 specified characters - the numbers 0-9, the letters a-z and A-Z, some basic punctuation symbols, some control codes that originated with Teletype machines, and a blank space - into the 7-bit binary integers.</p>
        <p>ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that use text.</p>
        <p>Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, though they support many additional characters.</p>
        <p>ASCII developed from telegraphic codes. Its first commercial use was as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bell Labs', 'C'); ?> data services.</p>
        <p>Work on the ASCII standard began on 6 October 1960, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) X3.2 subcommittee.</p>
        <p>ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing control characters (many now obsolete) that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters, including the space (which is considered an invisible graphic).</p>
