            Iain and I worked together on a number of successful projects.<br /><br />
            Iain's experience in a number of varied industries and his ability to adapt to different technologies and developmental environments allows him to become a valuable and reliable resource very quickly.<br /><br />
            Iain works equally well independently with little to no supervision or in larger project teams.<br /><br />
            I would recommend Iain for any role he puts his name up for.

            I worked with Iain in the eCommerce team at the AOT Group for approximately 5 years. During this time Iain worked as the lead developer and system architect.<br /><br />
            Iain's in depth knowledge of a large number of software languages and technical concepts allows him to be able to identify solutions and opportunities within very complex system environments.<br /><br />
            Within Iain's leadership role he was also one of the key authors of the teams SDLC policies which have become the backbone of the teams workflow. <br /><br />
            Iain is a pleasure to work with and would be an asset on any development team.

            Whilst at TigerRedi we looked high and low for a developer that had real creative flair and imagination.<br /><br />
            When Iain was recommend to us we jumped at the chance to bring him in to our team.<br /><br />
            Iain works very hard and is a mind of technical knowledge!<br /><br />
            Iain worked on accounts and build sites and applications for Honda, Kia Cars and Proton to name a few at TigerRedi with much enthusiasm.<br /><br />
            I would'nt hesitate to recommend Iain to any potential recruitment opportunity, we all certainly enjoyed working with Iain.

            I have worked with many developers in the past but none have shown the ability as Iain has to build sites completely cross platform and to show honest creative thinking within a technical enviroment.<br /><br />
            This in turn gave great confidence as a Creative Director to guarantee the right results for our clients.<br /><br />
            Iain gave nothing but 100% in commitment and was a total team player never hesitating to help out in areas well outside of his role's remit.<br /><br />
            He was the engine within the business, a valued and well liked member of the team and I would not hesitate to recommend him to a future employer.
