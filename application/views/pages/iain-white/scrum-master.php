        <p>I have been a <strong>Certified Scrum Master</strong> since November 2013.</p>

        <p>I am an experienced full stack Web Developer with Agile Team Leader experience with a deep understanding of the Software Development process.</p>

        <p>While my background and first love was in Software Engineering, I have found my niche managing projects and people in an Agile environment, while maintaining a very much hands on approach with the software codebase.</p>

        <p>My speciality is developing innovative cross technology solutions while staying focused on the needs of the end customer and the business. I have also had success with growing the capabilities of multi skilled teams to deliver complex web based applications that perform as required in a timely manner with happy and informed Product Owners and Stakeholders.</p>

        <p>I am an accomplished and fluent communicator and a certified Scrum Master with strong investigation, problem-solving and decision-making skills, combined with a pragmatic approach and sound business acumen.</p>

        <p>I have worked in both small and large companies and a variety of industries including manufacture, ISP, health, travel, news and marketing.</p>

        <h4>I was Scrum Master for <?php echo $this->stencil->elapsedYears('01/01/2013', TRUE, TRUE, '31/07/2014'); ?> at OnTheHouse.</h4>

        <?php echo $this->stencil->addImage('OnTheHouse', 'gif', 'right', 'companies'); ?>

        <p>In this role I remove impedances that would block the teamâ€™s productivity. I worked closely with Product Owners, Stakeholders, and Infrastructure. I facilitated the Scrum meetings including Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and Daily Stand-up.</p>

        <p>I was a key player in introducing Scrum to the company, simplifying the team's work-flow and using Jira Greenhopper as a Scrum board.</p>

        <p>I streamlined and formalised the release process and established a monthly release schedule.</p>

        <p>I established a dedicated fortnightly estimates meeting based on Story Points and using Estimate Planning Poker techniques.</p>

        <p>I have a proven record of delivering project on time and within budget often exceeding client expectations.</p>
