    <p>As Lead Web Developer I very hands on in designing and developing solutions in PHP and JavaScript as well as maintain the architecture of the web site and its mobile APIs.</p>

    <p>As Team Lead it was my responsibility to recruit, mentor and direct the development and testing team.</p>

    <p>In my role as Scrum Master I remove impedances that would block the team’s productivity.  I worked closely with Product Owners, Stakeholders, and Infrastructure. I facilitated the Scrum meetings including Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and Daily Stand-up.</p>

    <p>I was a key player in introducing Scrum to the company, simplifying the team’s workflow and using Jira Greenhopper as a Scrum board and taking on the role of Scrum Master.</p>

    <p>I streamlined and formalised the release process and established a monthly release schedule.</p>

    <p>I established a dedicated fortnightly estimates meeting based on Story Points and using Estimate Planning Poker techniques.</p>

        <li>Introducing Automatic Testing</li>
        <li>Using Jenkins CI</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I was responsible for adding sponsorship branding for major banks including Suncorp, Westpac, NAB and CBA.</p>

    <p>The company called on my experience on several occasions to perform Technical Due Diligence and to validate the performance of 3<sup>rd</sup> party solutions.</p>

    <p>I also provided training and a site boilerplate based on CodeIgniter for a new Research project developed by another team.</p>
