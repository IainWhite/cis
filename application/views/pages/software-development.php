        <p><strong>Software Development</strong> is the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('computer programming', 'SD'); ?>, documenting, and testing involved in creating and maintaining applications and frameworks involved in a software release life cycle and resulting in a software product.</p>
        <p>The term refers to a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process.</p>
        <p>Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.</p>
        <p>The need for better quality control of the software development process has given rise to the discipline of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Software Engineering', 'SD'); ?>, which aims to apply the systematic approach exemplified in the engineering paradigm to the process of software development.</p>
