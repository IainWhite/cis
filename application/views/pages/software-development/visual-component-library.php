        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('VCL - Visual Component Library'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Visual Component Library</strong> (<strong>VCL</strong>) is a visual component based object-oriented framework for developing the user interface of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> applications.</p>
        <p>It is written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Object Pascal', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The VCL was developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland', 'C'); ?> for use in, and is tightly integrated with, its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Delphi', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++ Builder', 'L'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RAD', 'PM'); ?> tools.</p>
        <p>In 1995 Borland released Delphi, its first release of and Object Pascal IDE and language.</p>
        <p>Up until that point, Borland's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Turbo Pascal', 'L'); ?> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> was largely a procedural language, with minimal object-oriented features, and building UI frameworks with the language required using frameworks like <strong>Turbo Vision</strong> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Object Windows Library', 'SD'); ?> (OWL), a similar framework to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MFC', 'SD'); ?>, required writing code to create UI objects.</p>
        <p>A key aim of the VCL combined with the Delphi language was to change the requirements of building a user interface.</p>
        <p>At the time, much UI code work required creating classes inheriting from other classes, and customized objects were often not reusable.</p>
        <p>UI code was also complicated, forcing the programmer to understand and use the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows API', 'SD'); ?>, manage <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GDI', 'SD'); ?> resources, etc.</p>
        <p>Finally, a visual user interface arguably should be designed visually, and yet most tools to do so - at the time, mainly <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual Basic', 'LB'); ?> - did so in terms of the designer outputting code, creating a fragile, un-manually-editable situation - a problem that still persists today with many UI frameworks, particularly <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++', 'LC'); ?> based ones such as <strong>Qt</strong>.</p>
