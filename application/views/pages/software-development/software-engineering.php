        <p><strong>Software Engineering</strong> is the study and application of engineering to the design, development, and maintenance of software.</p>
        <p>Typical formal definitions of software engineering are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software".</li>
            <li>"an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production"</li>
            <li>"the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The term has been used less formally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called computer programming and systems analysis</li>
            <li>as the broad term for all aspects of the practice of computer programming, as opposed to the theory of computer programming, which is called computer science</li>
            <li>as the term embodying the advocacy of a specific approach to computer programming, one that urges that it be treated as an engineering discipline rather than an art or a craft, and advocates the codification of recommended practices</li>
        </ul>
