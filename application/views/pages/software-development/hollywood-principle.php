        <p><strong>The Hollywood principle</strong> is a software design methodology that takes its name from the clich√© response given to amateurs auditioning in Hollywood: "<em>Don't call us, we'll call you</em>". It is a useful paradigm that assists in the development of code with high cohesion and low coupling that is easier to debug, maintain and test.</p>
        <p>Most beginners are first introduced to programming from a diametrically opposed viewpoint. Programs such as Hello World take control of the running environment and make calls on the underlying system to do their work. A considerable amount of successful software has been developed using the same principles, and indeed many developers need never think there is any other approach. After all, programs with linear flow are generally easy to understand.</p>
