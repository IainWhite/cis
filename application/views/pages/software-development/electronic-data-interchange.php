        <p><strong>Electronic Data Interchange</strong> (<strong>EDI</strong>) is an electronic communication system that provides standards for exchanging data via any electronic means.</p>

        <p>EDI has existed for more than 30 years, and there are many EDI standards (including X12, EDIFACT, ODETTE, etc.), some of which address the needs of specific industries or regions.</p>
