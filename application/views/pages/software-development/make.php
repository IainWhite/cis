        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Make'); ?>
        <p><strong>Make</strong> is a utility that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called <code>makefiles</code> which specify how to derive the target program.</p>
        <p>Although integrated development environments (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SW'); ?>) and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage a build process, Make remains widely used, especially in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Besides building programs, Make can be used to manage any project where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.</p>
        <p>Make was originally created by <strong>Stuart Feldman</strong> in April 1976 at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bell Labs', 'C'); ?>. In 2003 Dr. Feldman received the ACM Software System Award for the authoring of this widespread tool.</p>
