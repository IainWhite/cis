        <p><strong>Apache Flex</strong>, formerly <strong>Adobe Flex</strong>, is a software development kit (SDK) for the development and deployment of cross-platform rich Internet applications based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Flash', 'IT'); ?> platform. Initially developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macromedia', 'C'); ?> and then acquired by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Systems', 'C'); ?>, Flex was donated by Adobe to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apache Software Foundation', 'C'); ?> in 2011 and promoted to a top-level project in December 2012.</p>
        <p>The Flex 3 SDK was released under the open source <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mozilla Public License', 'LIC'); ?> in 2008. Consequently, Flex applications can be developed using standard IDEs, for example <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IntelliJ IDEA', 'IDE'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Eclipse', 'IDE'); ?>, the free and open source IDE <strong>FlashDevelop</strong>, as well as the proprietary <strong>Adobe Flash Builder</strong>. The latest version of the SDK is version 4.14.1.</p>
