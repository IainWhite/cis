        <p><strong>Computer programming</strong> (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable programs.</p>
        <p>It involves activities such as analysis, understanding, and generically solving such problems resulting in an algorithm, verification of requirements of the algorithm including its correctness and its resource consumption, implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of the algorithm in a target programming language, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system and management of derived artefacts such as machine code of computer programs.</p>
        <p>The algorithm is often only represented in human-parsable form and reasoned about using logic.</p>
        <p>Source code is written in one or more programming languages (such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PHP', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?>, etc.).</p>
        <p>The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solve a given problem.</p>
        <p>The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.</p>
