        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Shim'); ?>
        <p>In computer programming, a <strong>shim</strong> is a small library that transparently intercepts <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('API', 'SD'); ?> calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation elsewhere. Shims typically come about when the behaviour of an API changes, thereby causing compatibility issues for older applications which still rely on the older functionality. In such cases, the older API can still be supported by a thin compatibility layer on top of the newer code. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web polyfills', 'WD'); ?> are a related concept. Shims can also be used for running programs on different software platforms than they were developed for.</p>
