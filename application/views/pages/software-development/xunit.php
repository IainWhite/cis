        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('xUnit'); ?>
        <p><stroong>xUnit</strong> is the collective name for several unit testing frameworks that derive their structure and functionality from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Smalltalk', 'L'); ?>'s <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SUnit', 'languages/smalltalk'); ?>.</p>
        <p>SUnit, designed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Kent Beck', 'P'); ?> in 1998, was written in a highly-structured object-oriented style, which lent easily to contemporary languages such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C#', 'languages/c'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Following its introduction in Smalltalk the framework was ported to Java by Beck and Erich Gamma and gained wide popularity, eventually gaining ground in the majority of programming languages in current use. The names of many of these frameworks are a variation on "SUnit", usually substituting the "S" for the first letter (or letters) in the name of their intended language ("<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JUnit', 'languages/java'); ?>" for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?>, "RUnit" for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('R', 'L'); ?> etc.). These frameworks and their common architecture are collectively known as "xUnit".</p>
