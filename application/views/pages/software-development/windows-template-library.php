        <p>The <strong>Windows Template Library</strong> (<strong>WTL</strong>) is a free software, object-oriented <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++', 'LC'); ?> template library for <strong>Win32</strong> development.</p>
        <p>WTL was created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> employee <strong>Nenad Stefanovic</strong> for internal use and later released as an unsupported add-on to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual Studio', 'IDE'); ?> and the Win32 Framework SDK.</p>
        <p>It was developed primarily as a light weight alternative to the <strong>Microsoft Foundation Classes <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MFC', 'SD'); ?></strong> and builds upon Microsoft's ATL, another lightweight API widely used to create COM and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ActiveX', 'SD'); ?> libraries.</p>
