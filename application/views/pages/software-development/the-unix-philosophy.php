        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('The Unix Philosophy'); ?>
        <p><strong>The Unix philosophy</strong>, originated by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ken Thompson', 'P'); ?>, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to developing small yet capable software based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a "software tools" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the "Unix philosophy".</p>
        <p>The Unix philosophy emphasises building short, simple, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favours comparability as opposed to monolithic design.</p>
