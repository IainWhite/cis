        <p><strong>Convention over configuration</strong> (also known as <strong>coding by convention</strong>) is a software design paradigm which seeks to decrease the number of decisions that developers need to make, gaining simplicity, but not necessarily losing flexibility.</p>
        <p>The phrase essentially means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sale in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called "sales" by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table "product sales", that one needs to write code regarding these names.</p>
        <p>When the convention implemented by the tool matches the desired behaviour, it behaves as expected without having to write configuration files. Only when the desired behaviour deviates from the implemented convention is explicit configuration required.</p>
