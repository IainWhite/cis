        <p>An <strong>architectural pattern</strong> is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context. Architectural patterns are similar to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('software design patterns', 'SD'); ?> but have a broader scope. The architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations, high availability and minimisation of a business risk. Some architectural patterns have been implemented within software frameworks.</p>
