        <p><strong>There's more than one way to do it</strong> (<strong>TMTOWTDI</strong> or <strong>TIMTOWTDI</strong>, pronounced <em>Tim Toady</em>) is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Perl', 'L'); ?> programming motto. The language was designed with this idea in mind, in that it "<em>doesn't try to tell the programmer how to program</em>".</p>
