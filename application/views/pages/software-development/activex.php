        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('ActiveX'); ?>
        <p><strong>ActiveX</strong> is a software framework created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> which adapts its earlier <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Component Object Model', 'SD'); ?> (COM) and Object Linking and Embedding (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OLE', 'SD'); ?>) technologies for content downloaded from a network, particularly in the context of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('World Wide Web', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It was introduced 1996 and is commonly used in its <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> operating system.</p>
        <p>In principle it is not dependent on Microsoft Windows, but in practice, most ActiveX controls require either Microsoft Windows or a Windows emulator.</p>
        <p>Most also require the client to be running on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Intel x86', 'CPU'); ?> hardware, because they contain compiled code.</p>
        <p>Many Microsoft Windows applications - including many of those from Microsoft itself, such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'WB'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Office', 'ITS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Visual Studio', 'IDE'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Media Player', 'IT'); ?> use ActiveX controls to build their feature set and also encapsulate their own functionality as ActiveX controls which can then be embedded into other applications.</p>
        <p>Internet Explorer also allows the embedding of ActiveX controls in web pages. However, ActiveX will not work on all platforms, so using ActiveX controls to implement essential functionality of a web page restricts its usefulness.</p>
