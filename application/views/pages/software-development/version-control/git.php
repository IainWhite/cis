        <p><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed.</p>
        <p>Git was initially designed and developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linus Torvalds', 'P'); ?> for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux kernel', 'OS'); ?> development in 2005.</p>
        <p>Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.</p>
