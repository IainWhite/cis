        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Rietveld'); ?>
        <p><strong>Rietveld</strong> is a web-based collaborative code review tool for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Subversion', 'SDV'); ?> written by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> to run on Google's cloud service.</p>
        <p>Van Rossum based Rietveld on the experience he had writing <strong>Mondrian</strong>. Mondrian was a proprietary application used internally by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> to review their code.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Gerrit', 'SDV'); ?> is a fork of Rietveld started because ACL patches would not get integrated into Rietveld.</p>
