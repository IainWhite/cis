        <p><strong>Apache Subversion</strong> (often abbreviated <strong>SVN</strong>, after the command name <code>svn</code>) is a software versioning and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('revision control', 'SD'); ?> system distributed as free software under the Apache License.</p>
        <p>Developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation.</p>
        <p>Its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to the widely used <strong>Concurrent Versions System</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CVS', 'SDV'); ?>).</p>
