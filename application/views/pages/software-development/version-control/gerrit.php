        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Gerrit'); ?>
        <p><strong>Gerrit</strong> is a free, web-based team software code review tool.</p>
        <p>Software developers in a team can review each other's modifications on their source code using a Web browser and approve or reject those changes.</p>
        <p>It integrates closely with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Git', 'SDV'); ?>, a distributed version control system.</p>
        <p>Gerrit is a fork of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rietveld', 'SDV'); ?>, another code review tool.</p>
        <p>"Gerrit" is the given name of <strong>Gerrit Rietveld</strong> (1888 - 1964), a Dutch designer after whom <strong>Rietveld</strong> is named.</p>
        <p>It was developed at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> by <strong>Shawn Pearce</strong> for the development of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> project.</p>
        <p>Starting from a set of patches for Rietveld, it became a fork and evolved into a separate project when ACL patches wouldn't be merged into Rietveld by its author, <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong>.</p>
        <p>Gerrit was originally written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Python', 'L'); ?> like Rietveld, but it is now written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?>. Gerrit uses <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google Web Toolkit', 'LJ'); ?> to generate front-end <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> code from Java source.</p>
