        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('OOP - Object Oriented Programming'); ?>
        <p><strong>Object Oriented Programming</strong> (<strong>OOP</strong>) is a programming paradigm that represents the concept of "objects" that have data fields (attributes that describe the object) and associated procedures known as methods.</p>
        <p>Objects, which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Objective-C', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Smalltalk', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C#', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Perl', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Python', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ruby', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PHP', 'L'); ?> are examples of object-oriented programming languages.</p>
        <p>Object Oriented Programming is an approach to designing modular, reusable software systems.</p>
        <p>Although discussions of object-oriented technology can get trapped in the details of one language vs. the other, the real key to the object-oriented approach is that it is a modelling approach first.</p>
        <p>The object-oriented approach is considered a logical extension of good design practices that go back to the very beginning of computer programming rather than being revolutionary as claimed by some proponents.</p>
        <p>Object-orientation is simply the logical extension of older techniques such as structured programming and abstract data types.</p>
        <p>An object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance.</p>
        <p>Rather than structure programs as code and data, an object-oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an "object".</p>
        <p>An object has state (data) and behaviour (code).</p>
        <p>Objects correspond to things found in the real world. So for example, a graphics program will have objects such as circle and square.</p>
        <p>The goals of object-oriented programming are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased understanding.</li>
            <li>Ease of maintenance.</li>
            <li>Ease of evolution.</li>
        </ul>
