        <p><strong>Dynamic-link library</strong>, or <strong>DLL</strong>, is <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>'s implementation of the shared library concept in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?> operating systems.</p>
        <p>These libraries usually have the file extension DLL, OCX (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or DRV (for legacy system drivers).</p>
        <p>The file formats for DLLs are the same as for Windows EXE files â€“ that is, Portable Executable (PE) for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, and New Executable (NE) for 16-bit Windows. As with EXEs, DLLs can contain code, data, and resources, in any combination.</p>
