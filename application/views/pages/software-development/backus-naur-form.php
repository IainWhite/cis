        <p>In computer science, <strong>BNF</strong> (<strong>Backus Normal Form</strong> or <strong>Backusâ€“Naur Form</strong>) is one of the two main notation techniques for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocols; the other main technique for writing context-free grammars is the van Wijngaarden form.</p>
        <p>They are applied wherever exact descriptions of languages are needed: for instance, in official language specifications, in manuals, and in textbooks on programming language theory.</p>
