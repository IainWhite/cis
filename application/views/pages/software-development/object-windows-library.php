        <p>The <strong>Object Windows Library</strong> (<strong>OWL</strong>) is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland C++', 'LC'); ?> object-oriented framework originally designed for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows API', 'SD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It was used in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Turbo Pascal', 'L'); ?> for Windows, Borland Pascal and their Borland C++ package.</p>
        <p>It was a competitor to the <strong>Microsoft Foundation Class Library (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MFC', 'SD'); ?>)</strong>.</p>
        <p>OWL had incomplete support by the Borland C++ <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'ITS'); ?> and wasn't always upwardly compatible from release to release.</p>
        <p>It was eventually deprecated in favor of the <strong>Visual Component Library (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VCL', 'SD'); ?>)</strong>, which is written in Object Pascal and included in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Delphi', 'L'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++ Builder', 'CL'); ?>.</p>
