        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('DirectX'); ?>
        <p><strong>Microsoft DirectX</strong> is a collection of application programming interfaces (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('APIs', 'IT'); ?>) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> platforms.</p>
        <p>Originally, the names of these APIs all began with Direct, such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and so forth.</p>
        <p>The name DirectX was coined as shorthand term for all of these APIs (the X standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection.</p>
        <p>When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the X was used as the basis of the name <strong>XBox</strong> to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology.</p>
        <p>The X initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the XBox such as XInput and the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite.</p>
        <p>Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of video games for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft XBox, Microsoft XBox 360, and Microsoft XBox One.</p>
        <p>Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CAD', 'ITS'); ?> / <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CAM', 'IT'); ?> engineering.</p>
        <p>As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names "DirectX" and "Direct3D" used interchangeably.</p>
        <p>The DirectX software development kit (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SDK', 'SD'); ?>) consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding.</p>
        <p>Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 95', 'WIN'); ?> did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 98', 'WIN'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows NT 4.0', 'WIN'); ?> both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released since.</p>
        <p>The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the SDK samples.</p>
        <p>Starting with the release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 8', 'WIN'); ?> Developer Preview, DirectX SDK has been integrated into Windows SDK.</p>
