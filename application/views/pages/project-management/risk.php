        <p><strong>Risk</strong> is the potential of losing something of value. Values (such as physical health, social status, emotional well being or financial wealth) can be gained or lost when taking risk resulting from a given action, activity and / or inaction, foreseen or unforeseen. Risk can also be defined as the intentional interaction with uncertainty. Uncertainty is a potential, unpredictable, unmeasurable and uncontrollable outcome, risk is a consequence of action taken in spite of uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Risk perception is the subjective judgment people make about the severity and / or probability of a risk, and may vary person to person. Any human endeavour carries some risk, but some are much riskier than others.</p>
