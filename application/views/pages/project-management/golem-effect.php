        <p>The <strong>Golem effect</strong> is a psychological phenomenon in which lower expectations placed upon individuals either by supervisors or the individual themselves lead to poorer performance by the individual. This effect is mostly seen and studied in educational and organizational environments. It is a form of self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
        <p>The effect is named after the golem, a clay creature that was given life by <strong>Rabbi Loew</strong> of Prague in Jewish mythology. According to the legend, the golem was originally created to protect the Jews of Prague; however, over time, the golem grew more and more corrupt to the point of spiraling violently out of control and had to be destroyed. The effect was named after the golem legend in 1982 by Babad, Inbar, and Rosenthal because it "represent[s] the concerns of social scientists and educators, which are focused on the negative effects of self-fulfilling prophecies".</p>
        <p>The golem effect has very similar underlying principles to its theoretical counterpart, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pygmalion effect', 'PM'); ?>.</p>
