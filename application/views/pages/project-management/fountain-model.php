        <p>The <strong>Fountain Model</strong> is a highly iterative approach that is well-suited to object-oriented software development. The Fountain Model allows for the fact that there is considerable overlap of activities throughout the development cycle — although some activities can't start before others.Just as a fountain’s water rises up and falls back to the pool below, in object-oriented software development, the general workflow from analysis through design to implementation is overlaid with iterative cycles across many phases.</p>
