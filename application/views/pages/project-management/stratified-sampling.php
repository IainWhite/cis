        <p>In statistics, <strong>stratified sampling</strong> is a method of sampling from a population.</p>
        <p>In statistical surveys, when sub-populations within an overall population vary, it is advantageous to sample each sub-population (stratum) independently. Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. The strata should also be collectively exhaustive: no population element can be excluded. Then simple random sampling or systematic sampling is applied within each stratum. This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error. It can produce a weighted mean that has less variability than the arithmetic mean of a simple random sample of the population.</p>
