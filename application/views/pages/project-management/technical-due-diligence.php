        <p>Due diligence is an investigation of a business or person prior to signing a contract, or an act with a certain standard of care.</p>
        <p>It can be a legal obligation, but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary investigations. A common example of due diligence in various industries is the process through which a potential acquirer evaluates a target company or its assets for an acquisition. The theory behind due diligence holds that performing this type of investigation contributes significantly to informed decision making by enhancing the amount and quality of information available to decision makers and by ensuring that this information is systematically used to deliberate in a reflexive manner on the decision at hand and all its costs, benefits, and risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Technical due diligence</strong> gives an independent, third-party assessment and evaluation of the technical aspects of an investment project. Analysts identify potential risks and costs as well as opportunities from a technical point of view. This helps the investor to make an informed decision on whether to invest in the project or not.</p>
