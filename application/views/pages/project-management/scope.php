        <p>In <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Project Management', ''); ?>, the term scope has two distinct uses <strong>Project Scope</strong> and <strong>Product Scope</strong>.</p>
        <p>Scope involve getting information required to start a project, and the features the product would have that would meet its stakeholders requirements.</p>
        <p>Project Scope is the work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions.</p>
        <p>Product Scope is the features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result.</p>
        <p>Notice that Project Scope is more work-oriented, (<em>the hows</em>) while Product Scope is more oriented toward functional requirements. (<em>the whats</em>)</p>
        <p>If requirements aren't completely defined and described and if there is no effective change control in a project, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('scope creep', 'PM'); ?> may ensue.</p>
