        <p><strong>Extreme Project Management (XPM)</strong> refers to a method of managing very complex and very uncertain projects.</p>
        <p>Extreme project management differs from traditional project management mainly in its open, elastic and undeterministic approach. The main focus of XPM is on the human side of project management (e.g. managing project stakeholders), rather than on intricate scheduling techniques and heavy formalism.</p>
        <p>Advanced approaches to extreme project management utilize the principles of human interaction management to deal with the complexities of human collaboration.</p>
