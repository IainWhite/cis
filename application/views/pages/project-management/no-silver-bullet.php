        <p><strong>"<em>No Silver Bullet â€” Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering</em>"</strong> is a widely discussed paper on software engineering written by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Fred Brooks', 'P'); ?> in 1986.</p>
        <p>Brooks argues that "<em>there is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity</em>".</p>
        <p>He also states that "<em>we cannot expect ever to see two-fold gains every two years</em>" in software development, like there is in hardware development (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink("Moore's Law", 'W'); ?>).</p>
        <p>Brooks makes a distinction between accidental complexity and essential complexity, and asserts that most of what software engineers now do is devoted to the essential, so shrinking all the accidental activities to zero will not give an order-of-magnitude improvement.</p>
        <p>Brooks advocates addressing the essential parts of the software process.</p>
        <p>While Brooks insists that there is no one silver bullet, he believes that a series of innovations attacking essential complexity could lead to significant (perhaps greater than tenfold in a ten-year period) improvements.</p>
        <p>The article, and Brooks's own reflections on it, "<em>'No Silver Bullet' Refired</em>" can be found in the anniversary edition of his book <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('The Mythical Man-Month', 'B'); ?>.</p>
