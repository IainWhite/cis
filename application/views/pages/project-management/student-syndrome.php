        <p><strong>Student syndrome</strong> refers to planned academic procrastination, when a person will only start to apply themselves to an assignment at the last possible moment before its deadline. This eliminates any potential safety margins and puts the person under stress and pressure. It is done in order to induce a level of urgency high enough to ensure the proper amount of effort is put into the task.</p>
