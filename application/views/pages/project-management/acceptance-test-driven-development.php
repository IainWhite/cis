        <p><strong>Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)</strong> is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers. ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as Specification by Example, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Behavior Driven Development', 'PMA'); ?> (BDD), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Example-Driven Development', 'PM'); ?> (EDD), and Story <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Story Test-Deiven Development', 'PM'); ?> (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customerâ€™s needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language.</p>
        <p>ATDD is closely related to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Test-Driven Development', 'PMA'); ?> (TDD). It differs by the emphasis on developer-tester-business customer collaboration. ATDD encompasses acceptance testing, but highlights writing acceptance tests before developers begin coding.</p>
