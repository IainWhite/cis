        <p>A <strong>Project Manager</strong> is a professional in the field of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Project Management', ''); ?>. Project Managers can have the responsibility of the planning, execution and closing of any project, typically relating to construction industry, architecture, aerospace and defence, computer networking, telecommunications or software development.</p>
        <p>A Project Manager is the person responsible for accomplishing the stated <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('project', 'PM'); ?> objectives. Key project management responsibilities include creating clear and attainable project objectives, building the project requirements, and managing the constraints of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Project Management Triangle', 'PM'); ?>, which are cost, time, scope, and quality.</p>
        <p>A Project Manager is often a client representative and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the firm they are representing. A Project Manager is the bridging gap between the production team and client. So he / she must have a fair knowledge of the industry they are in so that they are capable of understanding and discussing the problems with either party. The ability to adapt to the various internal procedures of the contracting party, and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that the key issues of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realised.</p>
        <p>The term and title 'Project Manager' has come to be used generically to describe anyone given responsibility to complete a project. However, it is more properly used to describe a person with full responsibility and the same level of authority required to complete a project. If a person does not have high levels of both responsibility and authority then they are better described as a project administrator, coordinator, facilitator or expeditor.</p>
        <p>Project Management is quite often the province and responsibility of an individual Project Manager. This individual seldom participates directly in the activities that produce the end result, but rather strives to maintain the progress and mutual interaction and tasks of various parties in such a way that reduces the risk of overall failure, maximizes benefits, and restricts costs.</p>

        <p>The main components of project management are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding out the reason why a project is important</li>
            <li>Finding out the requirement of a project</li>
            <li>Specify the quality of the deliverable</li>
            <li>Resource estimate</li>
            <li>Timescale</li>
            <li>Preparation of a business case</li>
            <li>Investment, corporate agreement and funding</li>
            <li>Implementation of management plan on to the project</li>
            <li>Team building and motivation</li>
            <li>Risk assessments and change in the project</li>
            <li>Monitoring</li>
            <li>Stakeholder management</li>
            <li>Provider management</li>
            <li>Closing the project</li>
