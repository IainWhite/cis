        <p>The <strong>Open Unified Process (OpenUP)</strong> is a part of the <strong>Eclipse Process Framework (EPF)</strong>, an open source process framework developed within the <strong>Eclipse Foundation</strong>. Its goals are to make it easy to adopt the core of the <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rational Unified Process', 'PM'); ?> (RUP)</strong> / <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unified Process', 'PM'); ?></strong>.</p>
        <p>The OpenUP began with a donation to open source of process content known as the <strong>Basic Unified Process (BUP)</strong> by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>. It was transitioned to the Eclipse Foundation in late 2005 and renamed OpenUP/Basic in early 2006. It is now known simply as OpenUP.</p>
