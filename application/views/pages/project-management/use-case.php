        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Use Case'); ?>
        <p>In software and systems engineering, a <strong>use case</strong> is a list of steps, typically defining interactions between a role (known in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unified Modeling Language', 'SD'); ?> (UML) as an "actor") and a system, to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human, an external system, or time.</p>
        <p>In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Systems Modeling Language', 'SD'); ?> (SysML) or as contractual statements.</p>
        <p>Use Cases are an important requirement technique that have been widely used in modern software engineering since their formal introduction by Ivar Jacobson in 1992. Use case driven development is a key characteristic of process models and frameworks such as the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unified Process', 'PM'); ?> (UP), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rational Unified Process', 'PM'); ?> (RUP), and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Oracle Unified Method', 'PM'); ?> (OUM). With its iterative and evolutionary nature, the use case is also a good fit for agile development.</p>
