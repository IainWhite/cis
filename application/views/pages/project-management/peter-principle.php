        <p>The <strong>Peter principle</strong> is a concept in management theory formulated by <strong>Laurence J. Peter</strong> in which the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and "<em>managers rise to the level of their incompetence</em>".</p>
