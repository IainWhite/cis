        <p>The <strong>Seven Basic Tools of Quality</strong> is a designation given to a fixed set of graphical techniques identified as being most helpful in troubleshooting issues related to quality. They are called basic because they are suitable for people with little formal training in statistics and because they can be used to solve the vast majority of quality related issues. Proper usage of these 7 basic quality tools is the first step towards successful process improvements.</p>
        <p>The seven tools are</p>
        <ul>
            <li><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Cause and effect diagram', 'PM'); ?> (also known as the "fishbone" or Ishikawa diagram)</li>
            <li><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Check sheet', 'PM'); ?></li>
            <li><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Control chart', 'PM'); ?></li>
            <li><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Histogram', 'PM'); ?></li>
            <li><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pareto chart', 'PM'); ?></li>
            <li><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Scatter diagram', 'PM'); ?></li>
            <li><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Stratified sampling', 'PM'); ?> (alternately, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('flow chart', 'PM'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('run chart', 'PM'); ?>)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The designation arose in postwar Japan, inspired by the seven famous weapons of <strong>Benkei</strong>. It was possibly introduced by Kaoru Ishikawa who in turn was influenced by a series of lectures W. Edwards Deming had given to Japanese engineers and scientists in 1950. At that time, companies that had set about training their workforces in statistical quality control found that the complexity of the subject intimidated the vast majority of their workers and scaled back training to focus primarily on simpler methods which suffice for most quality related issues.</p>
        <p>The Seven Basic Tools stand in contrast to more advanced statistical methods such as survey sampling, acceptance sampling, statistical hypothesis testing, design of experiments, multivariate analysis, and various methods developed in the field of operations research.</p>
        <p>The <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Project Management Institute', 'C'); ?> references the Seven Basic Tools in <strong>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge</strong> as an example of a set of general tools useful for planning or controlling project quality.</p>
