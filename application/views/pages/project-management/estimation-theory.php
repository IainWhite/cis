        <p><strong>Estimation theory</strong> is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating the values of parameters based on measured / empirical data that has a random component. The parameters describe an underlying physical setting in such a way that their value affects the distribution of the measured data. An estimator attempts to approximate the unknown parameters using the measurements.</p>
