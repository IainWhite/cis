        <p><strong>The Magic Cauldron</strong> is an essay by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Eric S. Raymond', 'P'); ?> on the open source economic model. It can be read freely online, and was published in his book <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('The Cathedral and Bazaar', 'B'); ?> in 1999.</p>
        <p>The essay analyzes the economic models that Raymond believes can sustain an open-source project in four steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It first analyzes what the author sees as classical myths about the cost refund in software development and tries to present a game-theory based model of the supposed stability of open-source cooperation.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it presents nine theoretical models that would work for sustainable open-source development: two non-profit, seven for-profit.</li>
            <li>Thirdly it states a theory to decide when it is economically interesting for software to remain closed.</li>
            <li>Finally, it examines some mechanisms that, according to Raymond, the market invented to fund for-profit open-source development (like patronage system and task markets).</li>
        </ul>
