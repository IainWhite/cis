        <p><strong>Kaizen</strong> is Japanese for "<em>improvement</em>" or "<em>change for the best</em>", refers to philosophy or practices that focus upon continuous improvement of processes in manufacturing, engineering, business management or any process.</p>
        <p>It has been applied in healthcare, psychotherapy, life-coaching, government, banking, and other industries.</p>
        <p>When used in the business sense and applied to the workplace, kaizen refers to activities that continually improve all functions, and involves all employees from the CEO to the assembly line workers.</p>
        <p>It also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics, that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain.</p>
        <p>By improving standardized activities and processes, kaizen aims to eliminate waste.</p>
        <p>Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses after the Second World War, influenced in part by American business and quality management teachers who visited the country.</p>
        <p>It has since spread throughout the world and is now being implemented in environments outside of business and productivity.</p>
