        <p>The <strong>Wideband Delphi</strong> estimation method is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort. It derives from the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Delphi method', 'PM'); ?> which was developed in the 1950 - 1960s at the RAND Corporation as a forecasting tool. It has since been adapted across many industries to estimate many kinds of tasks, ranging from statistical data collection results to sales and marketing forecasts.</p>
        <p>Barry Boehm and John A. Farquhar originated the Wideband variant of the Delphi method in the 1970s. They called it "wideband" because, compared to the existing delphi method, the new method involved greater interaction and more communication between those participating. The method was popularised by Boehm's book Software Engineering Economics (1981). Boehm's original steps from this book were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Coordinator presents each expert with a specification and an estimation form.</li>
            <li>Coordinator calls a group meeting in which the experts discuss estimation issues with the coordinator and each other.</li>
            <li>Experts fill out forms anonymously.</li>
            <li>Coordinator prepares and distributes a summary of the estimates</li>
            <li>Coordinator calls a group meeting, specifically focusing on having the experts discuss points where their estimates vary widely</li>
            <li>Experts fill out forms, again anonymously, and steps 4 to 6 are iterated for as many rounds as appropriate.</li>
        </ol>
