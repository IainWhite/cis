        <p>A <strong>flowchart</strong> is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.</p>

        <p>Flowcharts are used in designing and documenting simple processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process, and perhaps also find flaws, bottlenecks, and other less obvious features within it. There are many different types of flowcharts, and each type has its own repertoire of boxes and notational conventions. The two most common types of boxes in a flowchart are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a processing step, usually called activity, and denoted as a rectangular box</li>
            <li>a decision, usually denoted as a diamond.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A flowchart is described as "cross functional" when the page is divided into different swimlanes describing the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular "lane" is within the control of that organizational unit. This technique allows the author to locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision correctly, showing the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process.</p>
        <p>Flowcharts depict certain aspects of processes and they are usually complemented by other types of diagram. For instance, <strong>Kaoru Ishikawa</strong> defined the flowchart as one of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Seven Basic Tools of Quality Control', 'PM'); ?>, next to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('histogram', 'PM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pareto chart', 'PM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('check sheet', 'PM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('control chart', 'PM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('cause and effect diagram', 'PM'); ?>, and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('scatter diagram', 'PM'); ?>. Similarly, in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UML', 'PM'); ?>, a standard concept modeling notation used in software development, the activity diagram, which is a type of flowchart, is just one of many different diagram types.</p>
        <p><strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Nassiâ€“Shneiderman Diagrams', 'PM'); ?></strong> and <strong>Drakon Charts</strong> are an alternative notation for process flow.</p>
        <p>Common alternative names include: flowchart, process flowchart, functional flowchart, process map, process chart, functional process chart, business process model, process model, process flow diagram, work flow diagram, business flow diagram. The terms "flowchart" and "flow chart" are used interchangeably.</p>
        <p>The underlying graph structure of a flow chart is a flow graph, which abstracts away node types, their contents and other ancillary information.</p>
