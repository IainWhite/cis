        <p><strong>Total Project Control (TPC)</strong> is a project management method that emphasises continuous tracking and optimization of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ROI', 'PM'); ?>. It was developed by Stephen Devaux. It builds upon earlier techniques such as earned value management, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('critical path method', 'PM'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Program Evaluation and Review Technique', 'PM'); ?>, but uses these to track and index projected project profitability as well as the more traditional cost and schedule. In this way it aims to manage projects as profit and investment centers, rather than cost centers.</p>
        <p>Introduced with TPC are a variety of project management metrics and techniques, among them critical path drag, the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Value Breakdown Structure', 'PM'); ?> (VBS), Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP), Doubled Resource Estimated Duration (DRED), and Cost of Leveling with Unresolved Bottlenecks (CLUB).</p>
