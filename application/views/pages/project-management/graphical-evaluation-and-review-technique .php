        <p><strong>Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique</strong>, commonly known as <strong>GERT</strong>, is a network analysis technique used in project management that allows probabilistic treatment of both network logic and estimation of activity duration. The technique was first described in 1966 by Dr. Alan B. Pritsker of Purdue University and WW Happ.</p>
        <p>Compared to other techniques, GERT is only rarely used in complex systems. Nevertheless, the GERT approach addresses the majority of the limitations associated with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PERT', 'PM'); ?> / <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CPM', 'PM'); ?> technique. GERT allows loops between tasks. The fundamental drawback associated with the GERT technique is the complex programme (Monte Carlo simulation) required to model the GERT system. Development in GERT includes Q-GERTS - allowing the user to consider queuing within the system.</p>
