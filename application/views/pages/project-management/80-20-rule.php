        <p>The <strong>Pareto principle</strong> (also known as the <strong>80-20 rule</strong>, <strong>the law of the vital few</strong>, and <strong>the principle of factor sparsity</strong>) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Management consultant <strong>Joseph M. Juran</strong> suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist <strong>Vilfredo Pareto</strong>, who, while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, published his first paper "Cours d'Ã©conomie politique." Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.</p>
        <p>It is a common rule of thumb in business; e.g. "<em></em>80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients</em>". Mathematically, the 80 - 20 rule is roughly followed by a power law distribution (also known as a Pareto distribution) for a particular set of parameters, and many natural phenomena have been shown empirically to exhibit such a distribution.</p>
