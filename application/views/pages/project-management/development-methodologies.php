        <p>A <strong>software development methodology</strong> or <strong>system development methodology</strong> in software engineering is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing an information system.</p>
        <p>Common methodologies include <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Waterfall', 'PMM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('prototyping', 'PMM'); ?>, iterative and incremental development, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('spiral development', 'PMM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rapid Application Development', 'PMM'); ?> (RAD), and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Extreme Programming', 'PMM'); ?>.</p>
        <p>A methodology can also include aspects of the development environment, model-based development, computer aided software development, and the utilization of particular frameworks (i.e. programming libraries or other tools).</p>
