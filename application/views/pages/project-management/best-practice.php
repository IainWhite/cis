        <p>A <strong>best practice</strong> is a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means, and that is used as a benchmark. In addition, a "best" practice can evolve to become better as improvements are discovered. Best practice is considered by some as a business buzzword, used to describe the process of developing and following a standard way of doing things that multiple organizations can use.</p>
        <p>Best practices are used to maintain quality as an alternative to mandatory legislated standards and can be based on self-assessment or benchmarking. Best practice is a feature of accredited management standards such as ISO 9000 and ISO 14001.</p>
        <p>Some consulting firms specialise in the area of best practice and offer pre-made 'templates' to standardise business process documentation. Sometimes a "best practice" is not applicable or is inappropriate for a particular organisation's needs. A key strategic talent required when applying best practice to organisations is the ability to balance the unique qualities of an organisation with the practices that it has in common with others.</p>
