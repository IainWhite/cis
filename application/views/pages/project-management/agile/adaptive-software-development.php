        <p><strong>Adaptive software development (ASD)</strong> is a software development process that grew out of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rapid Application Development', 'PMA'); ?> work by Jim Highsmith and Sam Bayer. It embodies the principle that continuous adaptation of the process to the work at hand is the normal state of affairs.</p>
        <p>Adaptive Software Development replaces the traditional <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('waterfall', 'PMM'); ?> cycle with a repeating series of speculate, collaborate, and learn cycles. This dynamic cycle provides for continuous learning and adaptation to the emergent state of the project. The characteristics of an ASD life cycle are that it is mission focused, feature based, iterative, timeboxed, risk driven, and change tolerant.</p>
        <p>The word speculate refers to the paradox of planning - it is more likely to assume that all stakeholders are comparably wrong for certain aspects of the projectâ€™s mission, while trying to define it. Collaboration refers to the efforts for balancing the work based on predictable parts of the environment (planning and guiding them) and adapting to the uncertain surrounding mix of changes caused by various factors, such as technology, requirements, stakeholders, software vendors. The learning cycles, challenging all stakeholders, are based on the short iterations with design, build and testing. During these iterations the knowledge is gathered by making small mistakes based on false assumptions and correcting those mistakes, thus leading to greater experience and eventually mastery in the problem domain.</p>
