        <p><strong>Feature-Driven Development (FDD)</strong> is an iterative and incremental software development process. It is one of a number of lightweight or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Agile', 'PM'); ?> methods for developing software. FDD blends a number of industry recognised best practices into a cohesive whole. These practices are all driven from a client-valued functionality (feature) perspective. Its main purpose is to deliver tangible, working software repeatedly in a timely manner.</p>
