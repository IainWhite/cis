        <p><strong>Agile Modeling (AM)</strong> is a methodology for modeling and documenting software systems based on best practices. It is a collection of values and principles, that can be applied on an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Agile software development', 'PM'); ?> project. This methodology is more flexible than traditional modeling methods, making it a better fit in a fast changing environment.</p>
        <p>Agile modeling is a supplement to other agile methodologies such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Scrum', 'PMA'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Extreme Programming', 'PMA'); ?> (XP), and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rational Unified Proccess', 'PMA'); ?> (RUP). It is explicitly included as part of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Disciplined Agile Delivery', 'PMA'); ?> (DAD) framework.</p>
