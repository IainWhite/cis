        <p><strong>Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)</strong> is a process decision framework that enables simplified process decisions around incremental and iterative solution delivery. DAD builds on the many practices espoused by advocates of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Agile software development', 'PM'); ?>, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Scrum', 'PMA'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Agile Modeling', 'PMA'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lean Software Development', 'PM'); ?>, and others.</p>
        <p>The primary reference for disciplined agile delivery is the book of same name, written by Scott Ambler and Mark Lines.</p>
        <p>In particular, DAD has been identified as a means of moving beyond Scrum. According to Cutter Senior Consultant Bhuvan Unhelkar, "<em>The DAD framework provides a carefully constructed mechanism that not only streamlines IT work, but more importantly, enables scaling</em>". Paul Gorans and Philippe Kruchten call for more discipline in implementation of Agile approaches and indicate that DAD, as an example framework, is "<em>a hybrid agile approach to enterprise IT solution delivery that provides a solid foundation from which to scale</em>".</p>
