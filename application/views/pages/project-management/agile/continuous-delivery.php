        <p><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD)</strong> is a software engineering approach in which teams keep producing valuable software in short cycles and ensure that the software can be reliably released at any time. It is used in software development to automate and improve the process of software delivery. Techniques such as automated testing and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Continuous Integration', 'PMA'); ?> (CI) allow software to be developed to a high standard and easily packaged and deployed to test environments, resulting in the ability to rapidly, reliably and repeatedly push out enhancements and bug fixes to customers at low risk and with minimal manual overhead. CD builds on CI by adding the regular deployments to production as part of the process, however CD is not a requirement of CI. The technique (CD) was one of the assumptions of extreme programming but at an enterprise level has developed into a discipline of its own, with job descriptions for roles such as "buildmaster" calling for CD skills as mandatory.</p>
