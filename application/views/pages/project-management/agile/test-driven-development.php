        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('TDD - Test Driven Development'); ?>
        <p><strong>Test Driven Development</strong> (<strong>TDD</strong>) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Kent Beck', 'P'); ?>, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.</p>
        <p>Test Driven Development is related to the test-first programming concepts of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Extreme Programming', 'PMA'); ?> (XP), begun in 1999, but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.</p>
