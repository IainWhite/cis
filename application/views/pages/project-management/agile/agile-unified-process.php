        <p><strong>Agile Unified Process (AUP)</strong> is a simplified version of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rational Unified Process', 'PM'); ?> (RUP) developed by Scott Ambler. It describes a simple, easy to understand approach to developing business application software using agile techniques and concepts yet still remaining true to the RUP. The AUP applies agile techniques including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Test-Driven Development', 'PMA'); ?> (TDD), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Agile Modeling', 'PMA'); ?> (AM), agile change management, and database refactoring to improve productivity.</p>
