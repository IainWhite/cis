        <p>In software development and product management, a <strong>user story</strong> is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function. User stories are used with agile software development methodologies as the basis for defining the functions a business system must provide, and to facilitate requirements management. It captures the 'who', 'what' and 'why' of a requirement in a simple, concise way, often limited in detail by what can be hand-written on a small paper notecard.</p>
        <p>User stories originated with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Extreme Programming', 'PMA'); ?> (XP), whose first written description in 1998 only claimed that customers defined project scope "with user stories, which are like use cases". Rather than offered as a distinct practice, they were described as one of the "game pieces" used in the planning game. However, most of the further literature thrust around all the ways arguing that user stories are "unlike" use cases, in trying to answer in a more practical manner "how requirements are handled" in XP and more generally [Agile] projects. This drives the emergence, over the years, of a more sophisticated account of user stories.</p>
        <p>In 2001, Ron Jeffries proposed the well-known <strong>Three C's formula</strong>, i.e. Card, Conversation, Confirmation, to capture the components of a user story:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Card (or often a Post-it note) is a physical token giving tangible and durable form to what would otherwise only be an abstraction;</li>
            <li>A Conversation is taking place at different time and places during a project between the various stakeholders concerned by the given feature (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.), which is largely verbal but most often supplemented by documentation;</li>
            <li>The Confirmation, the more formal the better, ensures that the objectives the conversation revolved around have been reached finally.</li>
        </ul>
