        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('BDD - Behavior-Driven Development'); ?>
        <p><strong>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</strong> is a software development process that emerged from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Test-Driven Development', 'PMA'); ?> (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Domain-Driven Design', 'PMA'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Object-Orientated Analysis', 'PMA'); ?> and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.</p>
        <p>Although BDD is principally an idea about how software development should be managed by both business interests and technical insight, the practice of BDD does assume the use of specialised software tools to support the development process. Although these tools are often developed specifically for use in BDD projects, they can be seen as specialised forms of the tooling that supports Test-Driven Development. The tools serve to add automation to the ubiquitous language that is a central theme of BDD.</p>
