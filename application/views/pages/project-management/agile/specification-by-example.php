        <p><strong>Specification By Example (SBE)</strong> is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements. It is applied in the context of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Agile software development', 'PM'); ?> methods, in particular <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Behavior-Driven Development', 'PMA'); ?> (BDD). This approach is particularly successful for managing requirements and functional tests on large-scale projects of significant domain and organisational complexity.</p>
        <p>Specification by example is also known as Example Driven Development, executable requirements, acceptance Test Driven Development, Agile Acceptance Testing.</p>
