        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('DDD - Domain Driven Design'); ?>
        <p><strong>Domain Driven Design (DDD)</strong> is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model. The premise of domain-driven design is the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic.</li>
            <li>Basing complex designs on a model of the domain.</li>
            <li>Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The term was coined by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Eric Evans', 'P'); ?> in his book of the same title.<p>
