        <p><strong>Just-In-Time (JIT) Manufacturing</strong>, also known as <strong>Just-In-Time Production</strong> or the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Toyota Production System', 'PML'); ?> (TPS), is a methodology aimed primarily at reducing flow times within production as well as response times from suppliers and to customers. Following its origin and development in Japan, largely in the 1960s and 1970s and particularly at Toyota, JIT migrated to Western industry in the 1980s, where its features were put into effect in many manufacturing companiesâ€”as is attested to in several books and compendia of case studies and articles from the 1980s.</p>
        <p>As is often the case with management initiatives, some firms, consultancies, and writers have posed alternate terms for JIT manufacturing. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Motorola', 'C'); ?>'s choice was <strong>Short Cycle Manufacturing (SCM)</strong>. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?>'s was <strong>Continuous Flow Manufacturing (CFM)</strong>, and <strong>Demand Flow Manufacturing (DFM)</strong>, a term handed down from consultant John Constanza at his Institute of Technology in Colorado. Still another alternate was mentioned by Goddard, who said that "Toyota Production System is often mistakenly referred to as the '<strong>Kanban System</strong>" and pointed out that kanban is but one element of TPS, as well as JIT production.</p>
        <p>But the wide use of the term JIT manufacturing throughout the 1980s faded fast in the 1990s, as the new term <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lean Manufacturing', 'PML'); ?> became established as "<em>a more recent name for JIT.</em>" As just one testament to the commonality of the two terms, Toyota Production System (TPS) has been and is widely used as a synonym for both JIT and lean manufacturing.</p>
