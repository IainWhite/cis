        <p>The <strong>Toyota Production System</strong> (TPS) is an integrated socio-technical system, developed by Toyota, that comprises its management philosophy and practices. The TPS organizes manufacturing and logistics for the automobile manufacturer, including interaction with suppliers and customers. The system is a major precursor of the more generic "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('lean manufacturing', 'PML'); ?>." Taiichi Ohno, and Eiji Toyoda developed the system between 1948 and 1975.</p>
        <p>Originally called "<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Just-In-Time Manufacturing', 'PML'); ?>", it builds on the approach created by the founder of Toyota, Sakichi Toyoda, his son Kiichiro Toyoda, and the engineer Taiichi Ohno. The principles underlying the TPS are embodied in The Toyota Way.</p>
