        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Muda'); ?>
        <p><strong>Muda</strong> is a Japanese word meaning "futility; uselessness; idleness; superfluity; waste; wastage; wastefulness", and is a key concept in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Toyota Production System', 'PML'); ?> (TPS) as one of the three types of deviation from optimal allocation of resources (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('muda', 'PML'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('mura', 'PML'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('muri', 'PML'); ?>). Waste reduction is an effective way to increase profitability. Toyota merely picked up these three words beginning with the prefix mu-, which in Japan are widely recognised as a reference to a product improvement program or campaign. A process adds value by producing goods or providing a service that a customer will pay for. A process consumes resources and waste occurs when more resources are consumed than are necessary to produce the goods or provide the service that the customer actually wants. The attitudes and tools of the TPS heighten awareness and give whole new perspectives on identifying waste and therefore the unexploited opportunities associated with reducing waste.</p>
        <p>Muda has been given much greater attention as waste than the other two which means that whilst many Lean practitioners have learned to see muda they fail to see in the same prominence the variation of mura (unevenness) and muri (overburden). Thus, while they are focused on getting their process under control they do not give enough time to process improvement by redesign.</p>
