        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Risk Register'); ?>
        <p>A <strong>risk register</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('risk management', 'PMR'); ?> tool commonly used in risk management and compliance . It acts as a central repository for all risks identified by the organisation and, for each risk, includes information such as source, nature, treatment option, existing counter measures, recommended counter measures and so on. It can sometimes be referred to as a <strong>risk log</strong> (for example in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PRINCE2', 'PMM'); ?>).</p>
        <p>A wide range of suggested contents for a risk register exist and recommendations are made by the <strong>Project Management Institute Body of Knowledge</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PMBOK', 'PM'); ?>) and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PRINCE2', 'PMM'); ?> among others. In addition many companies provide software tools that act as risk registers. Typically a risk register contains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A description of the risk</li>
            <li>The impact should this event actually occur</li>
            <li>The probability of its occurrence</li>
            <li>Risk Score (the multiplication of Probability and Impact)</li>
            <li>A summary of the planned response should the event occur</li>
            <li>A summary of the mitigation (the actions taken in advance to reduce the probability and / or impact of the event)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The risks are often ranked by Risk Score so as to highlight the highest priority risks to all involved.</p>
