        <p><strong>PDCA (plan–do–check–act or plan–do–check–adjust)</strong> is an iterative four-step management method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products. It is also known as the Deming circle / cycle / wheel, Shewhart cycle, control circle / cycle, or Plan–Do–Study–Act (PDSA). Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA. The added "O" stands for observation or as some versions say "Grasp the current condition." This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lean manufacturing', 'PML'); ?> / <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Toyota Production System', 'PML'); ?> literature.</p>

        <h2>PLAN</h2>
        <p>Establish the objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with the expected output (the target or goals). By establishing output expectations, the completeness and accuracy of the spec is also a part of the targeted improvement. When possible start on a small scale to test possible effects.</p>

        <h2>DO</h2>
        <p>Implement the plan, execute the process, make the product. Collect data for charting and analysis in the following "CHECK" and "ACT" steps.</p>

        <h2>CHECK</h2>
        <p>Study the actual results (measured and collected in "DO" above) and compare against the expected results (targets or goals from the "PLAN") to ascertain any differences. Look for deviation in implementation from the plan and also look for the appropriateness and completeness of the plan to enable the execution, i.e., "Do". Charting data can make this much easier to see trends over several PDCA cycles and in order to convert the collected data into information. Information is what you need for the next step "ACT".</p>

        <h2>ACT</h2>
        <p>If the CHECK shows that the PLAN that was implemented in DO is an improvement to the prior standard (baseline), then that becomes the new standard (baseline) for how the organisation should ACT going forward (new standards are enACTed). If the CHECK shows that the PLAN that was implemented in DO is not an improvement, then the existing standard (baseline) will remain in place. In either case, if the CHECK showed something different than expected (whether better or worse), then there is some more learning to be done... and that will suggest potential future PDCA cycles. Note that some who teach PDCA assert that the ACT involves making adjustments or corrective actions... but generally it would be counter to PDCA thinking to propose and decide upon alternative changes without using a proper PLAN phase, or to make them the new standard (baseline) without going through DO and CHECK steps.</p>
