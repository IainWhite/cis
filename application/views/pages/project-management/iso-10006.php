        <p><strong>ISO 10006:2003</strong>, Quality management systems - Guidelines for quality management in projects, is an international standard developed by the <strong>International Organization for Standardization</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IOS', 'C'); ?>).</p>
        <p>ISO 10006:2003 gives guidance on the application of quality management in projects.</p>
        <p>It is applicable to projects of varying complexity, small or large, of short or long duration, in different environments, and irrespective of the kind of product or process involved. This can necessitate some tailoring of the guidance to suit a particular project.</p>
        <p>ISO 10006:2003 is not a guide to "project management" itself. Guidance on quality in project management processes is discussed in this International Standard. Guidance on quality in a project's product-related processes, and on the "process approach", is covered in ISO 9004. A new "Project Management - Guide to project Management" ISO 21500 has been published in September 2012.</p>
        <p>Since ISO 10006:2003 is a guidance document, it is not intended to be used for certification / registration purposes.</p>
