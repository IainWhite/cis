        <p><strong>Control charts</strong>, also known as <strong>Shewhart charts</strong> (after <strong>Walter A. Shewhart</strong>) or <strong>process behavior charts</strong>, in statistical process control are tools used to determine if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of statistical control.</p>
        <p>If analysis of the control chart indicates that the process is currently under control (i.e., is stable, with variation only coming from sources common to the process), then no corrections or changes to process control parameters are needed or desired. In addition, data from the process can be used to predict the future performance of the process. If the chart indicates that the monitored process is not in control, analysis of the chart can help determine the sources of variation, as this will result in degraded process performance. A process that is stable but operating outside of desired (specification) limits (e.g., scrap rates may be in statistical control but above desired limits) needs to be improved through a deliberate effort to understand the causes of current performance and fundamentally improve the process.</p>
        <p>The control chart is one of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('seven basic tools of quality control', 'PM'); ?>. Typically control charts are used for time series data, though they can be used for data that have logical comparability (i.e. you want to compare samples that were taken all at the same time, or the performance of different individuals), however the type of chart used to do this requires consideration.</p>
