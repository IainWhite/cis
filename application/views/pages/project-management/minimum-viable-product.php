        <p>In product development, the <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong> is the product with the highest return on investment versus risk. The term was coined and defined by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Frank Robinson', 'P'); ?>, and popularised by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Steve Blank', 'P'); ?>,, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Eric Ries', 'P'); ?>, (for web applications). It may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand.</p>
        <p>A Minimum Viable Product has just those core features that allow the product to be deployed, and no more. The product is typically deployed to a subset of possible customers, such as early adopters that are thought to be more forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. It is a strategy targeted at avoiding building products that customers do not want, that seeks to maximize the information learned about the customer per dollar spent. "<em>The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort</em>". The definition's use of the words maximum and minimum means it is decidedly not formulaic. It requires judgment to figure out, for any given context, what MVP makes sense.</p>
        <p>An MVP is not a minimal product, it is a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers. It is an iterative process of idea generation, prototyping, presentation, data collection, analysis and learning. One seeks to minimize the total time spent on an iteration. The process is iterated until a desirable product / market fit is obtained, or until the product is deemed to be non-viable.</p>
        <p>Steve Blank typically refers to minimum viable product as minimum feature set.</p>
        <p>Steve Blank: "<em>Youâ€™re selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone</em>".</p>

        <h2>Purposes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources</li>
            <li>Accelerate learning</li>
            <li>Reduce wasted engineering hours</li>
            <li>Get the product to early customers as soon as possible</li>
            <li>Base for other products</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Results from a minimum viable product test aim to indicate if the product should ever be built to begin with. Testing will evaluate if the initial problem or goal has been solved in a manner which makes sense to move forward.</li>
