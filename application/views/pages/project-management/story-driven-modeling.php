        <p><strong>Story-Driven Modeling</strong> is an object-oriented modeling technique. Other forms of object-oriented modeling focus on class diagrams. Class diagrams describe the static structure of a program, i.e. the building blocks of a program and how they relate to each other. Class diagrams also model data structures, but with an emphasis on rather abstract concepts like types and type features.</p>
        <p>Instead of abstract static structures, story-driven modeling focuses on concrete example scenarios and on how the steps of the example scenarios may be represented as object diagrams and how these object diagrams evolve during scenario execution.</p>
