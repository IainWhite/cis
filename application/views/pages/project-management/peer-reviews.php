        <p>In Software Development, a <strong>peer review</strong> is a type of software review in which a work product (document, code, or other) is examined by its author and one or more colleagues, in order to evaluate its technical content and quality.</p>
        <p>The purpose of a peer review is to provide "a disciplined engineering practice for detecting and correcting defects in software artefacts, and preventing their leakage into field operations" according to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Capability Maturity Model', 'PM'); ?>.</p>
        <p>When performed as part of each Software development process activity, peer reviews identify problems that can be fixed early in the lifecycle. That is to say, a peer review that identifies a requirements problem during the Requirements analysis activity is cheaper and easier to fix than during the Software architecture or Software testing activities.</p>
        <p>The National Software Quality Experiment, evaluating the effectiveness of peer reviews, finds, "a favorable return on investment for software inspections; savings exceeds costs by 4 to 1". To state it another way, it is four times more costly, on average, to identify and fix a software problem later.</p>
