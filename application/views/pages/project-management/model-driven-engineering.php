        <p><strong>Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)</strong> is a software development methodology which focuses on creating and exploiting domain models, which are conceptual models of all the topics related to a specific problem. Hence it highlights and aims at abstract representations of the knowledge and activities that govern a particular application domain, rather than the computing concepts.</p>
