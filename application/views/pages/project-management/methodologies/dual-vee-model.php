        <p>The <strong>Dual Vee Model</strong> builds on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('V-model', 'PMM'); ?> to cleanly depict the complexity associated with designing and developing systems. In systems engineering it defines a uniform procedure for product or project development. The model depicts concurrent development of a system's architecture as one Vee with each entity of that architecture as another Vee that intersects the architecture Vee. This clearly shows interactions and sequences in developing a complex system and a system of systems.</p>
