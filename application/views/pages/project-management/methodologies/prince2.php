        <p><strong>PRINCE2</strong> (an acronym for <strong>Projects in Controlled Environments</strong>, version 2) is a project management methodology. It was developed by the UK government agency <strong>Office of Government Commerce</strong> (<strong>OGC</strong>) and is used extensively within the UK government as the de facto project management standard for its public projects. The methodology encompasses the management, control and organisation of a project. PRINCE2 is also used to refer to the training and accreditation of authorised practitioners of the methodology who must undertake accredited qualifications to obtain certification.</p>
        <p>PRINCE2 derives from an earlier method called <strong>PROMPTII</strong> and from the <strong>PRINCE</strong> project-management method, which was initially developed in 1989 by the <strong>Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency</strong> (<strong>CCTA</strong>) as a UK Government standard for information systems (IT) project management. PRINCE is an acronym for Projects In a Controlled Environment. However, it soon became regularly applied outside the purely IT environment.</p>
        <p>PRINCE2 was released in 1996 as a generic project management method. PRINCE2 has become increasingly popular and is now a de facto standard for project management in many UK government departments and across the United Nations system.</p>
