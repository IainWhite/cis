        <p>The <strong>Systems / Software Development Life Cycle</strong> (<strong>SDLC</strong>), also referred to as the <strong>Application Development Life Cycle</strong>, is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.</p>
        <p>The systems development life cycle concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both.</p>
        <p>A systems development life cycle is composed of a number of clearly defined and distinct work phases which are used by systems engineers and systems developers to plan for, design, build, test, and deliver information systems.</p>
        <p>Like anything that is manufactured on an assembly line, an SDLC aims to produce high quality systems that meet or exceed customer expectations, based on customer requirements, by delivering systems which move through each clearly defined phase, within scheduled time frames and cost estimates.</p>
        <p>Computer systems are complex and often link multiple traditional systems potentially supplied by different software vendors.</p>
        <p>To manage this level of complexity, a number of SDLC models or methodologies have been created, such as <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Waterfall', 'PMM'); ?></strong>, <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Spiral', 'PMM'); ?></strong>, <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Agile', 'PM'); ?></strong> and <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RAD', 'PMM'); ?></strong>.</p>
        <p>SDLC can be described along a spectrum of agile to iterative to sequential.</p>
        <p>Agile methodologies, such as <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('XP', 'PMA'); ?></strong> and <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Scrum', 'PMA'); ?></strong>, focus on lightweight processes which allow for rapid changes (without necessarily following the pattern of SDLC approach) along the development cycle.</p>
        <p>Iterative methodologies, such as <strong><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rational Unified Process', 'PM'); ?></strong> and <strong>Dynamic Systems Development</strong> method, focus on limited project scope and expanding or improving products by multiple iterations.</p>
        <p>Sequential or big design up front (BDUF) models, such as waterfall, focus on complete and correct planning to guide large projects and risks to successful and predictable results.</p>
        <p>Other models, such as anamorphic development, tend to focus on a form of development that is guided by project scope and adaptive iterations of feature development.</p>
        <p>In project management a project can be defined both with a <strong>Project Life Cycle</strong> (<strong>PLC</strong>) and an SDLC, during which slightly different activities occur.</p>
        <p>According to Taylor (2004) "<em>the project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the project, while the systems development life cycle focuses on realizing the product requirements</em>".</p>
