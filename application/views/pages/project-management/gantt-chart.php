        <p>A <strong>Gantt chart</strong> is a type of bar chart, adapted by Karol Adamiecki in 1896, and independently by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that illustrates a project schedule. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements comprise the work breakdown structure of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities.</p>
        <p>The first known tool of this type was developed in 1896 by Karol Adamiecki, who called it a <em>harmonogram</em>. Adamiecki did not publish his chart until 1931, however, and only in Polish, which limited both its adoption and recognition of his authorship. The chart is named after <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Henry Gantt', 'P'); ?> (1861 - 1919), who designed his chart around the years 1910 - 1915.</p>
        <p>One of the first major applications of Gantt charts was by the United States during World War I, at the instigation of General William Crozier.</p>
        <p>In the 1980s, personal computers allowed for widespread creation of complex and elaborate Gantt charts. The first desktop applications were intended mainly for project managers and project schedulers. With the advent of the internet and increased collaboration over networks at the end of the 1990s, Gantt charts became a common feature of web-based applications, including collaborative groupware.</p>
