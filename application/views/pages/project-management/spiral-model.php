        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Spiral Model'); ?>
        <p>The <strong>Spiral model</strong>, also known as the <strong>Spiral Lifecycle Model</strong>, is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Systems Development Lifecycle', 'PM'); ?> (SDLC) model used in Information Technology. This model of development combines the features of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Prototyping Model', 'PM'); ?> and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Waterfall model', 'PM'); ?>. The Spiral Model is favored for large, expensive, and complicated projects.</p>
        <p>The steps in the spiral model can be generalised as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The new system requirements are defined in as much detail as possible. This usually involves interviewing a number of users representing all the external or internal users and other aspects of the existing system.</li>
            <li>A preliminary design is created for the new system.</li>
            <li>A first prototype of the new system is constructed from the preliminary design. This is usually a scaled-down system, and represents an approximation of the characteristics of the final product.</li>
            <li>A second prototype is evolved by a fourfold procedure: (1) evaluating the first prototype in terms of its strengths, weaknesses, and risks; (2) defining the requirements of the second prototype; (3) planning and designing the second prototype; (4) constructing and testing the second prototype.</li>
            <li>At the customer's option, the entire project can be aborted if the risk is deemed too great. Risk factors might involve development cost overruns, operating-cost miscalculation, or any other factor that could, in the customer's judgment, result in a less-than-satisfactory final product.</li>
            <li>The existing prototype is evaluated in the same manner as was the previous prototype, and, if necessary, another prototype is developed from it according to the fourfold procedure outlined above.</li>
            <li>The preceding steps are iterated until the customer is satisfied that the refined prototype represents the final product desired.
            <li>The final system is constructed, based on the refined prototype.</li>
            <li>The final system is thoroughly evaluated and tested. Routine maintenance is carried out on a continuing basis to prevent large-scale failures and to minimize downtime.</li>
        </ol>
