        <p>A <strong>cost overrun</strong>, also known as a <strong>cost increase</strong> or <strong>budget overrun</strong>, involves unexpected costs incurred in excess of budgeted amounts due to an underestimation of the actual cost during budgeting. Cost overrun should be distinguished from cost escalation, which is used to express an anticipated growth in a budgeted cost due to factors such as inflation.</p>
        <p>Cost overrun is common in infrastructure, building, and technology projects.</p>
