        <p><strong>JAD (Joint Application Development)</strong> is a methodology that involves the client or end user in the design and development of an application, through a succession of collaborative workshops called JAD sessions. <strong>Chuck Morris</strong> and Tony Crawford, both of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', '/companies'); ?>, developed JAD in the late 1970s and began teaching the approach through workshops in 1980.</p>
        <p>The JAD approach, in comparison with the more traditional practice, is thought to lead to faster development times and greater client satisfaction, because the client is involved throughout the development process. In comparison, in the traditional approach to systems development, the developer investigates the system requirements and develops an application, with client input consisting of a series of interviews.</p>
