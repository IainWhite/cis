        <p><strong>Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)</strong> is a method of planning and managing projects that emphasises the resources required to execute project tasks. It was developed by <strong>Eliyahu M. Goldratt</strong>. It differs from more traditional methods that derive from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('critical path', 'PM'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PERT', 'PM'); ?> algorithms, which emphasise task order and rigid scheduling. A critical chain project network strives to keep resources levelly loaded, but requires that they be flexible in start times, and quickly switch between tasks and task chains to keep the project on schedule.</p>
