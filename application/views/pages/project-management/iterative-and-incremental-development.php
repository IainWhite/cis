        <p><strong>Iterative and Incremental development</strong> is any combination of both <strong>iterative design</strong> or <strong>iterative method</strong> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('incremental build model', 'PMM'); ?> for software development. The combination is of long standing and has been widely suggested for large development efforts. For example, the 1985 DOD-STD-2167 mentions (in section 4.1.2): "During software development, more than one iteration of the software development cycle may be in progress at the same time." and "This process may be described as an 'evolutionary acquisition' or 'incremental build' approach." The relationship between iterations and increments is determined by the overall software development methodology and software development process. The exact number and nature of the particular incremental builds and what is iterated will be specific to each individual development effort.</p>
        <p>Iterative and incremental development are essential parts of the modified <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('waterfall models', 'PMM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rational Unified Process', 'PM'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Extreme Programming', 'PMA'); ?> and generally the various <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Agile software development', 'PM'); ?> frameworks.</p>
        <p>It follows a similar process to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('plan-do-check-act cycle', 'PM'); ?> of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('business process improvement', 'PM'); ?>.</p>
