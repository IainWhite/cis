        <p>In contemporary business and science a <strong>Project</strong> is defined as a collaborative enterprise, involving research or design, that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim.</p>
        <p>Projects can be further defined as temporary rather than permanent social systems or work systems that are constituted by teams within or across organisations to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints. An ongoing Project is usually called (or evolves into) a Program.</p>
        <p>The word <em>Project</em> comes the Latin word <em>projectum</em> from the Latin verb <em>proicere</em>, "<em>before an action</em>" which in turn comes from <em>pro-</em>, which denotes precedence, something that comes before something else in time and <em>iacere</em>, "<em>to do</em>". The word "<em>Project</em>" thus actually originally meant "<em>before an action</em>".</p>
        <p>When the English language initially adopted the word, it referred to a plan of something, not to the act of actually carrying this plan out. Something performed in accordance with a project became known as an "object".</p>
