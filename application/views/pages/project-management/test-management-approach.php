        <p><strong>Test Management Approach (TMap)</strong> is a software testing approach. TMap is an approach that combines insights on how to test and what to manage, as well as techniques for the individual test consultant.</p>
        <p>The first method was created in 1995 and written by Martin Pol, Ruud Teunissen en Erik van Veenendaal. At the end of 2006 a new version was published called TMap Next written by other authors (Tim Koomen, Michiel Vroon, Leo van der Aalst & Bart Broekman). The main reason for this new version was the aim to create a more process focused description of the test process and put more emphasis on the business objectives as a guidance for the testing process.</p>
        <p>TMap was created by the Dutch division of Sogeti which is part of Capgemini.</p>
