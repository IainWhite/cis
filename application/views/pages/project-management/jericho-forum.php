        <p>The <strong>Jericho Forum</strong> is a global organization formed to help members deal the challenges of information security in an increasingly complex environment.</p>
        <p>In 2003, a group of CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers) gathered to discuss the security issues created when organisations work in collaboration with third party suppliers and sub-contractors and the corporate boundaries are increasingly blurred. A member of the group, Paul Simmonds, coined the term deperimeterization to describe the breakdown of network boundaries.</p>
        <p>The Jericho Forum grew out of that gathering and came into formal existence in January 2004. The Forum seeks to protect enterprise systems and data on multiple levels, through a well defined mix of encryption, secure protocols and data level authentication. To that end, the organization exists to articulate member needs and motivate development of products that meet those needs.</p>
        <p>Current members from Europe, North America and Asia Pacific include government organisations and academics as well as customer and supplier companies. Member representatives are usually CISO/CTO or other C-level employees. The Open Group oversees the Forum.</p>
        <p>The Forum says it is "dedicated to the idea that success in today's business environment is dependent upon the ability to collaborate and do business by enabling the secure flow of data over the Internet".</p>
