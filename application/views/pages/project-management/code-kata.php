        <p>A <strong>code kata</strong> is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.</p>
        <p>The term was probably first coined by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Dave Thomas', 'P'); ?>, co-author of the book <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('The Pragmatic Programmer', 'B'); ?>, in a bow to the Japanese concept of '<em>kata</em>' in the martial arts.</p>
        <p>Kata (literally: <em>form</em>) is a Japanese word describing detailed choreographed patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs.</p>
