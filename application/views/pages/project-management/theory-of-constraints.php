        <p>The <strong>Theory Of Constraints (TOC)</strong> is a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. There is always at least one constraint, and TOC uses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organisation around it.</p>
        <p>TOC adopts the common idiom "<em>a chain is no stronger than its weakest link</em>". This means that processes, organisations, etc., are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the outcome.</p>
