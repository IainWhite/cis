        <p><strong>Business Information Services Library (BiSL)</strong>, previously known as Business Information Service Management Library, is a framework used for information management.</p>
        <p>BiSL is a public domain standard since 2005, governed by the ASL BiSL foundation (previously ASL Foundation).</p>
        <p>The framework describes a standard for processes within business information management at the strategy, management and operations level.</p>
        <p>BiSL is closely related to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ITIL', 'project-management/it-service-managment'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ASL', 'project-management/it-service-managment'); ?> framework, yet the main difference between these frameworks is that ITIL and ASL focus on the supply side of information (the purpose of an IT organisation), whereas BiSL focuses on the demand side (arising from the end user organisation).</p>
        <p>BiSL was originally developed in the Netherlands by RCC/Roccade Atribit. It was first described by Deurloo c.s. in an article "Model voor Functioneel Beheer", in the Dutch annual 'IT Beheer Jaarboek', edition 1998.</p>
