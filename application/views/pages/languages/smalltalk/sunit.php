        <p><strong>SUnit</strong> is a unit testing framework for the programming language <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Smalltalk', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It is the original source of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('xUnit', 'SD'); ?> design, originally written by the creator of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Extreme Programming', 'PMA'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Kent Beck', 'P'); ?>.</p>
        <p>SUnit allows writing tests and checking results in Smalltalk. The resulting tests are very stable, but this method has the disadvantage that testers must be able to write simple Smalltalk programs.</p>
