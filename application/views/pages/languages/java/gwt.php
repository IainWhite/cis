        <p><strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</strong> is an open source set of tools that allows web developers to create and maintain complex <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> front-end applications in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Other than a few native libraries, everything is Java source that can be built on any supported platform with the included GWT build files. It is licensed under the Apache License version 2.0.</p>
        <p>GWT emphasizes reusable approaches to common web development tasks, namely asynchronous remote procedure calls, history management, bookmarking, UI abstraction, internationalization, and cross-browser portability.</p>
