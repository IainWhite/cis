        <p><strong>Java bytecode</strong> is the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JVM', 'LJ'); ?>).</p>
        <p>Each bytecode is composed by one, or in some cases two, bytes that represent the instruction (opcode), along with zero or more bytes for passing parameters.</p>
        <p>Of the possible 256 byte-long opcodes, 198 are currently in use, 51 are reserved for future use, and 3 are set aside as permanently unimplemented.</p>
