        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Java ME'); ?>
        <p><strong>Java Platform, Micro Edition</strong>, or <strong>Java ME</strong>, is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> platform designed for embedded systems (mobile devices are one kind of such systems).</p>
        <p>Target devices range from industrial controls to mobile phones and set-top boxes.</p>
        <p>Java ME was formerly known as <strong>Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME)</strong>.</p>
        <p>Java ME was designed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sun Microsystems', 'C'); ?>, acquired by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Oracle Corporation', 'C'); ?> in 2010; the platform replaced a similar technology, <strong>PersonalJava</strong>.</p>
        <p>Originally developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 68, the different flavours of Java ME have evolved in separate JSRs.</p>
        <p>Sun provides a reference implementation of the specification, but has tended not to provide free binary implementations of its Java ME runtime environment for mobile devices, rather relying on third parties to provide their own.</p>
