        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Visual J#'); ?>
        <p><strong>Visual J#</strong> (pronounced '<em>jay-sharp</em>') programming language was a transitional language for programmers of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('.NET Framework', 'L'); ?>.
        <p>J# worked with Java bytecode as well as source so it could be used to transition applications that used third-party libraries even if their original source code was unavailable.</p>
