        <p>A <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong>JVM</strong>) is a process virtual machine that can execute <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java bytecode', 'LJ'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It is the code execution component of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> platform. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Sun Microsystems', 'C'); ?> has stated that there are over 5.5 billion JVM-enabled devices.</p>
        <p>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets compiled Java binary code (called bytecode) for a computer's processor (or "hardware platform") so that it can perform a Java program's instructions.</p>
        <p>Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform.</p>
        <p>A Java virtual machine makes this possible because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the platform.</p>
