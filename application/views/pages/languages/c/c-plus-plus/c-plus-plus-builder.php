        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('C++ Builder'); ?>
        <p><strong>C++Builder</strong> is a rapid application development (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RAD', 'PMA'); ?>) environment, originally developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland', 'C'); ?> and as of 2009 owned by <strong>Embarcadero Technologies</strong>, for writing programs in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++', 'languages/c'); ?> programming language targeting <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>C++Builder combines the <strong>Visual Component Library</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VCL', 'SD'); ?>) and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SW'); ?> written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Delphi', 'L'); ?> with a C++ compiler.</p>
        <p>Most components developed in Delphi can be used in C++ Builder with no or little modification, although the reverse is not true.</p>
        <p>C++Builder includes tools that allow drag-and-drop visual development, making programming easier by incorporating a WYSIWYG graphical user interface builder.</p>
        <p>C++Builder uses the same IDE as Delphi, and shares many core libraries.</p>
        <p>Notable shared Delphi (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pascal', 'L'); ?> code) and C++ Builder routines include the <strong>FastMM4</strong> memory manager, which was developed as a community effort within the FastCode project, the entire UI framework known as the VCL, which is written in Pascal, as well as base system routines, many of which have been optimised for both Delphi and C++ Builder through the FastCode project.</p>
        <p>C++ Builder projects can include Delphi code. The Delphi compiler emits C++ headers, allowing C++ code to link to Delphi classes and methods as though they were written in C++. The reverse (C++ code being used by Delphi) is not possible.</p>
