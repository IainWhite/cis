        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Turbo C++'); ?>
        <p><strong>Turbo C++</strong> was a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?> compiler and Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SW'); ?>) and computer language originally from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Most recently it was distributed by <strong>Embarcadero Technologies</strong>, which acquired all of Borland's compiler tools with the purchase of its <strong>CodeGear</strong> division in 2008.</p>
        <p>The original Turbo C++ product line was put on hold after 1994 and was revived in 2006 as an introductory-level IDE, essentially a stripped-down version of their flagship <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++ Builder', 'languages/c/c-plus-plus'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Turbo C++ 2006 was released on 5 September 2006 and was available in 'Explorer' and 'Professional' editions.</p>
        <p>The Explorer edition was free to download and distribute while the Professional edition was a commercial product.</p>
        <p>In October 2009 Embarcadero Technologies discontinued support of its 2006 C++ editions. As such, the Explorer edition is no longer available for download and the Professional edition is no longer available for purchase from Embarcadero Technologies. Turbo C++ is succeeded by C++ Builder.</p>
