        <p>The <strong>Lattice C Compiler</strong> was released in June 1982 by <strong>Lifeboat Associates</strong> and was the first <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?> compiler for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM Personal Computer', 'ITH'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The compiler sold for $500 and would run on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PC DOS', 'OS'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS DOS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The hardware requirements were 96K of RAM and two floppy drives.</p>
        <p>It was ported to many other platforms, such as mainframes (MVS), minicomputers (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VMS', 'OS'); ?>), workstations (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('UNIX', 'OS'); ?>), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?>, the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and the Sinclair QL.</p>
        <p>The compiler was subsequently repackaged by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> under a distribution agreement as <strong>Microsoft C</strong> version 2.0.</p>
        <p>Microsoft developed their own C compiler that was released in April 1985 as Microsoft C Compiler 3.0.</p>
        <p>Lattice was purchased by <strong>SAS Institute</strong> in 1987. After this, support for other platforms dwindled until compiler development ceased for all platforms except <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> mainframes.</p>
        <p>The product is still available in versions that run on other platforms, but these are cross compilers that only produce mainframe code.</p>
