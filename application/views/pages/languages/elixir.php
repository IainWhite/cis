        <p><strong>Elixir</strong> is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language built atop the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM).</p>
        <p>Elixir builds on top of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Erlang', 'L'); ?> to provide distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time, non-stop applications but also extends it to support meta-programming with macros and polymorphism via protocols.</p>
        <p>Jos&eacute; Valim is the creator of the Elixir programming language.</p>
        <p>His goals were to enable higher extensibility and productivity in the Erlang VM while keeping compatibility with Erlang's tools and ecosystem.</p>
