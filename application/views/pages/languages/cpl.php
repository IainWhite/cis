        <p><strong>CPL</strong> (from <strong>C</strong>ombined <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>L</strong>anguage and <strong>C</strong>ambridge <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>L</strong>anguage before that) is a multi-paradigm programming language, that was developed in the early 1960s.</p>
        <p>CPL was developed jointly between the Mathematical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge and the University of London Computer Unit during the 1960s hence CPL gained the nickname "<em>Cambridge Plus London</em>".</p>
        <p>The collaborative effort was responsible for the "Combined" in the name of the language (previously, the name was Cambridge Programming Language).</p>
        <p>It was heavily influenced by {'ALGOL'|link_urls:'/l'}<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ALGOL', 'L'); ?> 60, but instead of being extremely small, elegant and simple, CPL was intended for a wider application area than scientific calculations and was therefore much more complex and not as elegant as ALGOL 60.</p>
        <p>CPL attempted to go beyond ALGOL to include industrial process control, business data processing and possibly some early command line games.</p>
        <p>CPL was intended to allow low-level programming and high level abstractions using the same language.</p>
