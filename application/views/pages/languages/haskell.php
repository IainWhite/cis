        <p><strong>Haskell</strong> is a standardized, general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics and strong static typing.</p>
        <p>It is named after logician <strong>Haskell Curry</strong>.</p>
        <p>In Haskell, "a function is a first-class citizen" of the programming language. As a functional programming language, the primary control construct is the function.</p>
        <p>Haskell features lazy evaluation, pattern matching, list comprehension, type classes, and type polymorphism.</p>
        <p>It is a purely functional language, which means that in general, functions in Haskell do not have side effects.</p>
        <p>There is a distinct construct for representing side effects, orthogonal to the type of functions.</p>
        <p>A pure function may return a side effect which is subsequently executed, modelling the impure functions of other languages.</p>
        <p>Haskell has a strong, static type system based on Hindleyâ€“Milner type inference.</p>
        <p>Haskell's principal innovation in this area is to add type classes, which were originally conceived as a principled way to add overloading to the language, but have since found many more uses.</p>
        <p>The construct which represents side effects is an example of a monad. Monads are a general framework which can model different kinds of computation, including error handling, nondeterminism, parsing, and software transactional memory.</p>
        <p>Monads are defined as ordinary datatypes, but Haskell provides some syntactic sugar for their use.</p>
