        <p><strong>AppleScript</strong> is a scripting language created by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Inc', 'C'); ?> and built into <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> operating systems since System 7.</p>
        <p>The term "<em>AppleScript</em>" may refer to the scripting system itself, or to an individual script written in the AppleScript language.</p>
        <p>AppleScript is primarily a scripting language developed by Apple to do Inter-Application Communication (IAC) using AppleEvents.</p>
        <p>AppleScript is related to, but different from, AppleEvents. AppleEvents is designed to exchange data between and control other applications in order to automate repetitive tasks.</p>
        <p>AppleScript has some limited processing abilities of its own, in addition to sending and receiving AppleEvents to applications.</p>
        <p>AppleScript can do basic calculation, and can do intricate text processing â€“ and it is extensible, allowing the addition of scripting additions which add new functions to the language itself.</p>
        <p>Mainly, however, AppleScript relies on the functionality of applications and processes to handle complex tasks.</p>
        <p>AppleScript has some elements of object-oriented programming, particularly in the construction of script objects, and natural language programming tendencies in its syntax, but does not strictly conform to either category.</p>
