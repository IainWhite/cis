        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Eiffel Programming Language'); ?>
        <p><strong>Eiffel</strong> is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ISO', 'C'); ?> standardized, object-oriented programming language designed by <strong>Bertrand Meyer</strong> (an object-orientation proponent and author of <strong>Object-Oriented Software Construction</strong>) and Eiffel Software.</p>
        <p>The design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method. Both are based on a set of principles, including design by contract, command-query separation, the uniform-access principle, the single-choice principle, the open-closed principle, and option-operand separation.</p>
        <p>Many concepts initially introduced by Eiffel later found their way into <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C#', 'L'); ?>, and other languages.</p>
