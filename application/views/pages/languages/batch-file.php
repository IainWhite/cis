        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Batch File'); ?>
        <p>A <strong>batch file</strong> is a kind of script file in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS/2', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command line interpreter, stored in a plain text file. A batch file may contain any command the interpreter accepts interactively and use constructs that enable conditional branching and looping within the batch file, such as "if", "for", "goto" and labels.</p>
        <p>Similar to <strong>Job Control Language (JCL)</strong> and other systems on mainframe and minicomputer systems, batch files were added to ease the work required for certain regular tasks by allowing the user to set up a script to automate them. When a batch file is run, the shell program (usually <code>COMMAND.COM</code> or <code>cmd.exe</code>) reads the file and executes its commands, normally line-by-line. <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix-like', 'OS'); ?> operating systems (such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>) have a similar, but more flexible, type of file called a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('shell scripts', 'L'); ?>.
