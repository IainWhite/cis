        <p><strong>BASIC</strong> (an acronym for <strong>B</strong>eginner's <strong>A</strong>ll-purpose <strong>S</strong>ymbolic <strong>I</strong>nstruction <strong>C</strong>ode) is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasises ease of use.</p>
        <p>In 1964, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('John Kemeny', 'P'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Thomas Kurtz', 'P'); ?> designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers.</p>
        <p>At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn how to use.</p>
        <p>Versions of BASIC became widespread on microcomputers in the mid-1970s and 1980s.</p>
        <p>Microcomputers usually shipped with BASIC, often in the machine's firmware.</p>
        <p>Having an easy-to-learn language on these early personal computers allowed small business owners, professionals, hobbyists, and consultants to develop custom software on computers they could afford.</p>
        <p>BASIC remains popular in many dialects and in new languages influenced by BASIC, such as Microsoft's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual Basic', 'LB'); ?>.</p>
