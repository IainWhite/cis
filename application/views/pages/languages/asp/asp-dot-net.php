        <p><strong>ASP.NET</strong> is an open source server-side Web application framework designed for Web development to produce dynamic Web pages. It was developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.</p>
        <p>It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('.NET Framework', 'L'); ?>, and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ASP', 'L'); ?>) technology. ASP.NET is built on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Common Language Runtime', 'L'); ?> (CLR), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SOAP', 'WD'); ?> extension framework allows ASP.NET components to process SOAP messages.</p>
