        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Assembly Language'); ?>
        <p><strong>Assembly language</strong> is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('machine code', 'L'); ?> instructions.</p>
        <p>Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, in contrast to most high-level programming languages, which are generally portable across multiple architectures, but require interpreting or compiling.</p>
        <p>Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler; the conversion process is referred to as assembly, or assembling the code.</p>
        <p>Assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent each low-level machine instruction or operation.</p>
        <p>Typical operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction, and most assemblers can therefore take labels, symbols and expressions as operands to represent addresses and other constants, freeing the programmer from tedious manual calculations.</p>
        <p>Macro assemblers include a macroinstruction facility so that (parameterised) assembly language text can be represented by a name, and that name can be used to insert the expanded text into other code.</p>
        <p>Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid debugging.</p>
