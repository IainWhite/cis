        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('VBScript'); ?>
        <p><strong>VBScript</strong> (<strong>Visual Basic Scripting Edition</strong>) is an Active Scripting language developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> that is modelled on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual Basic', 'LB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It is designed as a "lightweight" language with a fast interpreter for use in a wide variety of Microsoft environments.</p>
        <p>VBScript uses the Component Object Model to access elements of the environment within which it is running; for example, the FileSystemObject (FSO) is used to create, read, update and delete files.</p>
        <p>VBScript has been installed by default in every desktop release of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> since <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 98', 'OS'); ?>, in Windows Server since Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack and optionally with Windows CE (depending on the device it is installed on).</p>
        <p>A VBScript script must be executed within a host environment, of which there are several provided with Microsoft Windows, including: Windows Script Host (WSH), Internet Explorer (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IE', 'WB'); ?>), and Internet Information Services (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IIS', 'WS'); ?>).</p>
