        <p><stronog>Occam</strong> is a concurrent programming language that builds on the <strong>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)</strong> process algebra, and shares many of its features.</p>
        <p>It is named after <strong>William of Ockham</strong> of <strong>Occam's Razor</strong> fame.</p>
        <p>Occam is an imperative procedural language (such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pascal', 'L'); ?>).</p>
        <p>It was developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('David May', 'P'); ?> and others at <strong>INMOS</strong>, advised by Tony Hoare, as the native programming language for their transputer microprocessors, but implementations for other platforms are available.</p>
