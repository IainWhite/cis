        <p><strong>Mambo</strong> (formerly named <strong>Mambo Open Source</strong> or <strong>MOS</strong>) was a free software / open source Content Management System (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CMS', 'WD'); ?>) for creating and managing websites through a simple web interface.</p>
        <p>Its last release was in 2008, by which time all of the developers had left for forks of the project, mainly <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Joomla', 'PHP'); ?> and <strong>MiaCMS</strong>.</p>
        <p>Mambo included features such as page caching to improve performance on busy sites, advanced templating techniques, and a fairly robust API. It could provide <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RSS', 'WD'); ?> feeds and automate many tasks, including web indexing of static pages.</p>
        <p>Interface features included printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, forums, polls, calendars, website searching, language internationalization, and others.</p>
