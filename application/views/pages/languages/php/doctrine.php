        <p>The Doctrine Project (or <strong>Doctrine</strong>) is a set of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PHP', 'L'); ?> libraries primarily focused on providing persistence services and related functionality. Its prize projects are an <strong>Object Relational Mapper</strong> (<strong>ORM</strong>) and the Database Abstraction Layer it is built on top of.</p>
        <p>One of Doctrine's key features is the option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SQL', 'DB'); ?> dialect called <strong>Doctrine Query Language</strong> (<strong>DQL</strong>).</p>
        <p>Doctrine was started by <strong>Konsta Vesterinen</strong>, also known as <em>zYne-</em>. The project's initial commit was made on 13 April 2006 to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SVN', 'IT'); ?> repository.</p>
        <p>Doctrine 1.0.0 was released on 1 September 2008. The first stable version of Doctrine 2.0 was released on 22 December 2010.</p>
