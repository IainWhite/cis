        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('CodeIgniter PHP Framework'); ?>
        <p><strong>CodeIgniter</strong> is an open source rapid development web application framework, for use in building dynamic web sites with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PHP', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>CodeIgniter is loosely based on the popular <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Model View Controller', 'SDA'); ?> development pattern. While controller classes are a necessary part of development under CodeIgniter, models and views are optional.</p>
        <p>CodeIgniter is most often noted for its speed when compared to other <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PHP frameworks', 'PHP'); ?>. In a critical take on PHP frameworks in general, PHP creator <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Rasmus Lerdorf', 'P'); ?> spoke at frOSCon in August 2008, noting that he liked CodeIgniter "<em>because it is faster, lighter and the least like a framework</em>"</p>
        <p>The first public version of CodeIgniter was released by EllisLab on 28 February 2006, and the latest stable version 3.0.0 was released 30 March 30, 2015. On 9 July 2013, EllisLab announced that it was seeking a new owner for CodeIgniter, citing a lack of resources to give the framework the attention they felt it deserved. On 6 October 2014, EllisLab announced that CodeIgniter would continue development under the stewardship of the British Columbia Institute of Technology.</p>
