        <p><strong>Akka</strong> is an open-source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent applications on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Java', 'L'); ?> platform. Akka supports multiple programming models for concurrency, but it emphasises actor-based concurrency, with inspiration drawn from <strong>Erlang</strong>.
        <p>Language bindings exist for both Java and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Scala', 'L'); ?>. Akka is written in Scala, and as of Scala 2.10, Akka's actor implementation is included as part of the Scala standard library.</p>
