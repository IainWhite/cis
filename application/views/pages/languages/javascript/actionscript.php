        <p><strong>ActionScript</strong> is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macromedia Inc', 'C'); ?> (now owned by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Adobe Systems', 'C'); ?>).</p>
        <p>It is a dialect of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ECMAScript', 'JS'); ?> (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?>), and is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Flash Player', 'WD'); ?> platform, used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files.</p>
        <p>ActionScript 3 is also used with the <strong>Adobe Integrated Runtime</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AIR', 'IT'); ?>) system for the development of desktop and mobile applications.</p>
