        <p><strong>Node.js</strong> is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?>, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FreeBSD', 'OS'); ?>, NonStop, IBM AIX, IBM System z and IBM i. Its work is hosted and supported by the <strong>Node.js Foundation</strong>, a Collaborative Project at Linux Foundation.</p>
        <p>Node.js provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability. These technologies are commonly used for real-time web applications.</p>
        <p>Node.js uses the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('google V8', 'web-development/javascript-engines'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript engine', 'WD'); ?> to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript. Node.js contains a built-in library to allow applications to act as a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web server', 'WD'); ?> without software such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apache HTTP Server', 'wS'); ?> or [IIS]<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IIS', 'WS'); ?>.</p>
