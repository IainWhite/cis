        <p><strong>Modernizr</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> library which is designed to detect <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML5', 'WD'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS-3', 'WD'); ?> features in various browsers. Since the specifications for both HTML5 and CSS3 are only partially implemented or nonexistent in many browsers, it can be difficult to determine which techniques are available for use in rendering a page, and when it is necessary to avoid using a feature or to load a workaround such as a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('shim', 'SD'); ?> to emulate the feature. Modernizr aims to provide this feature detection in a complete and standardised manner.</p>
