        <p><strong>Backbone.js is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> library with a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RESTful', 'WD'); ?> <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JSON', 'WD'); ?> interface and is based on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Model View Presenter', 'SD'); ?> (MVP) application design paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only dependency is on one JavaScript library, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Underscore.js', 'JSF'); ?>. It is designed for developing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Single Page Applications', 'WD'); ?>, and for keeping various parts of web applications (e.g. multiple clients and the server) synchronised. Backbone was created by <strong>Jeremy Ashkenas</strong>, who is also known for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CoffeeScript', 'L'); ?>.</p>
