        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('MochiKit JavaScript Library'); ?>
        <p><strong>MochiKit</strong> is a light-weight <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> library written and maintained by <strong>Bob Ippolito</strong>.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Python', 'L'); ?> networking framework, <strong>Twisted</strong>, it uses the concept of deferred execution to allow asynchronous behaviour. This has made it useful in the development of interactive web pages which maintain a dialog with the web server, sometimes called <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AJAX', 'WD'); ?> applications.</p>
        <p>Of particular note is its ability to load and manipulate <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JSON', 'WD'); ?> encoded data sets, and MochiKit.DOM, a set of functions to easily create dynamic page components.</p>
        <p>MochiKit forms the foundation of the client-side functionality of the TurboGears Python web-application stack. Perhaps as a result of the author's involvement in the Python community, MochiKit exhibits many idioms familiar to Python programmers, and is commonly used in Python-based web applications.</p>
