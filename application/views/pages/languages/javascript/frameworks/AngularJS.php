        <p><strong>Underscore.js</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It is comparable to features provided by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Prototype', 'JSF'); ?> and the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ruby', 'L'); ?> language, but opts for a functional programming design instead of extending object prototypes. For example, Underscore.js's _.each function delegates to the host environment's native forEach implementation when present, or a compatible version when absent. The documentation refers to Underscore.js as "<em>the tie to go along with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('jQuery', 'JS'); ?>'s tux, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Backbone.js', 'JSF'); ?>'s suspenders</em>". Underscore.js was created by <strong>Jeremy Ashkenas</strong>, who is also known for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Backbone.js', 'JSF'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CoffeeScript', 'L'); ?>.</p>
