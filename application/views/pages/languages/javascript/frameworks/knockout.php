        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Knockout JavaScript Library'); ?>
        <p><strong>Knockout</strong> is a standalone <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> implementation of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Model View ViewModel', 'SD'); ?> pattern with templates. The underlying principles are therefore:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a clear separation between domain data, view components and data to be displayed</li>
            <li>the presence of a clearly defined layer of specialized code to manage the relationships between the view components</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The latter leverages the native event management features of the JavaScript language.</p>
        <p>These features streamline and simplify the specification of complex relationships between view components, which in turn make the display more responsive and the user experience richer.</p>
