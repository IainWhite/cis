        <p><strong>jQuery</strong> is a cross-platform <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by <strong>John Resig</strong>.</p>
        <p>It is currently developed by a team of developers led by Dave Methvin.</p>
        <p>Used by over 80% of the 10,000 most visited websites, jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today.</p>
        <p>jQuery is free, open source software, licensed under the MIT License.</p>
        <p>jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOM', 'WD'); ?> elements, create animations, handle events, and develop <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AJAX', 'WD'); ?> applications.</p>
        <p>jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets.</p>
        <p>The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>
        <p>The set of jQuery core features DOM element selections, traversal and manipulation enabled by its selector engine (named "<strong>Sizzle</strong>" from v1.3), created a new "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures; and influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('YUI', 'JS'); ?> v3 and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Dojo', 'JS'); ?>.</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Nokia', 'C'); ?> bundle jQuery on their platforms. Microsoft includes it with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual Studio', 'IDE'); ?> for use within Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX framework and ASP.NET MVC Framework while Nokia has integrated it into the Web Run-Time widget development platform.</p>
        <p>jQuery has also been used in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MediaWiki', 'WD'); ?> since version 1.16.</p>
