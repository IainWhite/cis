        <p><strong>script.aculo.us</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> library built on the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Prototype', 'JSF'); ?> JavaScript Framework, providing dynamic visual effects and user interface elements via the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
        <p>It is most notably included with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ruby on Rails', 'L'); ?> and Seaside, but also provided separately to work with other web application frameworks and scripting languages.</p>
        <p>script.aculo.us was extracted by <strong>Thomas Fuchs</strong> from his work on <strong>fluxiom</strong>, a web based digital asset management tool by the design company wollzelle. It was first released to the public in June 2005.</p>
