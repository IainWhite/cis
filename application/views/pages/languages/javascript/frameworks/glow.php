        <p><strong>Glow</strong> is an open-source <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> library created by the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC', 'C'); ?>. Development on Glow began in 2007, and it was publicly released under an Apache License in July 2009.</p>
        <p>The rationale for the development of the library, as opposed to using other libraries such as <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('jQuery', 'JS'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('YUI', 'JSF'); ?>, was to meet the BBC's stated targets for cross-browser compatibility (particularly <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari 1.3', 'WB'); ?>) that are of particular use in creating a website that uses data that corresponds to times, for example broadcast metadata.</p>
