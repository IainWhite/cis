        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('qooxdoo JavaScript Library'); ?>
        <p><strong>qooxdoo</strong> is an open source <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AJAX', 'WD'); ?> web application framework. It is an LGPL and / or EPL licensed client-side and server-agnostic solution, and includes support for professional <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> development, a graphical user interface (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?>) toolkit and high-level client-server communication.</p>
        <p>qooxdoo is entirely class-based, tries to leverage the features of object-oriented JavaScript and is based on namespaces. Most modern browsers are supported, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Gecko', 'WD'); ?> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Firefox', 'WB'); ?>, Mozilla, SeaMonkey), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Presto', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Opera', 'WB'); ?>), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Trident', 'web-development/layout-engines'); ?> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Internet Explorer', 'wB'); ?>, RealPlayer, Winamp), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('WebKit', 'web-developer/layout-engines'); ?> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Chrome', 'WB'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Safari', 'WB'); ?>). It includes an API reference that is auto-generated from Javadoc-like comments. Among the accompanying tool set is a comprehensive JavaScript parser that is an integral part of the automatic build process and is used to optimize, compress, link and deploy custom applications, and generate documentation. Internationalisation and localisation of applications are supported.</p>
