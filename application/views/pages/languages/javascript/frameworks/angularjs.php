        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('AngularJS JavaScript Framework'); ?>
        <p><strong>AngularJS</strong> (commonly referred to as "<strong>Angular</strong>") is an open-source web application framework maintained by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Single Page Applications', 'wD'); ?>. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Model View Controller', 'SD'); ?> (MVC) and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Model View ViewModel', 'SD'); ?> (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.</p>
        <p>The AngularJS library works by first reading the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML', 'WD'); ?> page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JSON', 'WD'); ?> resources.</p>
