        <p>The <strong>Prototype JavaScript Framework</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> framework created by <strong>Sam Stephenson</strong> in February 2005 as part of the foundation for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('AJAX', 'WD'); ?> support in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Ruby on Rails', 'L'); ?>. It is implemented as a single file of JavaScript code, usually named <code>prototype.js</code>. Prototype is distributed standalone, but also as part of larger projects, such as Ruby on Rails, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('script.aculo.us', 'JSF'); ?> and Rico.</p>
