        <p><strong>D3.js</strong> (or just <strong>D3</strong> for <strong>Data-Driven Documents</strong>) is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JavaScript', 'L'); ?> library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualisations in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Web browsers', 'WD'); ?>. It makes use of the widely implemented <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('SVG', 'WD'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('HTML5', 'WD'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CSS', 'WD'); ?> standards. It is the successor to the earlier <strong>Protovis</strong> framework. In contrast to many other libraries, D3.js allows great control over the final visual result. Its development was noted in 2011, as version 2.0.0 was released in August 2011.</p>
