        <p><strong>Visual FoxPro</strong> is a data-centric object-oriented procedural programming language produced by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It is derived from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('FoxPro', 'DB'); ?> (originally known as <strong>FoxBASE</strong>) which was developed by <strong>Fox Software</strong> beginning in 1984.</p>
        <p>Fox Technologies merged with Microsoft in 1992, after which the software acquired further features and the prefix "<em>Visual</em>".</p>
        <p>The last version of FoxPro (2.6) worked under <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Visual FoxPro 3.0, the first "Visual" version, reduced platform support to only Mac and Windows, and later versions were Windows only.</p>
