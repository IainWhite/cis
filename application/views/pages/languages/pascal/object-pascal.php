        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Object Pascal'); ?>
        <p><strong>Object Pascal</strong> refers to a branch of object-oriented derivatives of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pascal', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Object Pascal is an extension of the Pascal language that was developed at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Computer', 'C'); ?> by a team led by Larry Tesler in consultation with Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of Pascal.</p>
        <p>It is descended from an earlier object-oriented version of Pascal called <strong>Clascal</strong>, which was available on the Lisa computer.</p>
        <p>Object Pascal was needed in order to support MacApp, an expandable <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Macintosh', 'ITH'); ?> application framework that would now be called a class library.</p>
        <p>Object Pascal extensions and MacApp itself were developed by Barry Haynes, Ken Doyle, and Larry Rosenstein, and were tested by Dan Allen.</p>
        <p>Larry Tesler oversaw the project, which began very early in 1985 and became a product in 1986.</p>
        <p>In 1986, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland', 'C'); ?> introduced similar extensions, also called Object Pascal, to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Turbo Pascal', 'languages/pascal'); ?> product for the Macintosh, and in 1989 for Turbo Pascal 5.5 for DOS.</p>
        <p>When Borland refocused from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> in 1994, they created a successor to Turbo Pascal, called <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Delphi', 'L'); ?> and introduced a new set of extensions to create what is now known as the Delphi language.</p>
