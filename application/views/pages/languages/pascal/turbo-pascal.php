        <p><strong>Turbo Pascal</strong> is a software development system that includes a compiler and an Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SWI'); ?>) for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pascal', 'L'); ?> programming language running on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M-86', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland', 'C'); ?> under Philippe Kahn's leadership.</p>
        <p>From version 6 both a lower-priced Turbo Pascal and more expensive <strong>Borland Pascal</strong> were produced; Borland Pascal had more libraries and standard library source code.</p>
        <p>The name Borland Pascal is also used more generically for Borland's dialect of Pascal.</p>
