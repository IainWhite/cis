        <p><strong>PerlScript</strong> was initially solely an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ActiveX', 'IT'); ?> Scripting Engine produced by the company ActiveState for use with Microsoft's Internet Information Services (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IIS', 'WS'); ?>) that allows for programmers to use Perl-based code in addition to, or in place of, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VBScript', 'L'); ?> or <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('JScript', 'JS'); ?> in the context of web servers running the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ASP', 'L'); ?> protocol.</p>
        <p>Subsequently <strong>Apache::ASP</strong> was created for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apache', 'WS'); ?> web server, which allows for coding with only <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Perl', 'L'); ?>, but neither VBScript nor JScript.</p>
        <p>PerlScript can also be used to write Windows Script Host-based programs, similar to VBScript.</p>
