        <p><strong>Logo</strong> is an educational programming language, designed in 1967 by Daniel G. Bobrow, Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon.</p>
        <p>Today the language is remembered mainly for its use of "turtle graphics", in which commands for movement and drawing produced line graphics either on screen or with a small robot called a "turtle".</p>
        <p>The language was originally conceived to teach concepts of programming related to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Lisp', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The name "<em>Logo</em>" is not an acronym. It was derived from the Greek <em>logos</em> meaning "<em>word</em>" or "<em>thought</em>" by Feurzeig, to distinguish itself from other programming languages that were primarily numbers, not graphics or logic, oriented.</p>
