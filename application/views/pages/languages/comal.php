        <p><strrong>COMAL (Common Algorithmic Language)</strong> is a computer programming language developed in Denmark by Benedict Løfstedt and Børge R. Christensen in 1973.</p>
        <p>The "COMAL 80 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE REPORT" contains the formal definition of the language.</p>
        <p>COMAL was created as a mixture of the prevalent educational programming languages of the time, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BASIC', 'L'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pascal', 'L'); ?>, and, at least in the Commodore and Compis versions, the "turtle graphics" of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Logo', 'L'); ?>. The language was meant to introduce structured programming elements in an environment where BASIC would normally be used.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980s, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Apple Computer', 'C'); ?> won a contract to supply Apple II computers running <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?> and COMAL to Irish secondary schools.</p>
        <p>Between 1984 - 1987 TeleNova, a subsidiary of the industrial arm of the Swedish Telecoms system, Teli industrier manufactured a desktop PC called "Compis" for the educational sector. An enhanced version of COMAL was supplied as the standard programming language for this PC. Versions were created for both CP/M86 and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS-DOS', 'OS'); ?>. The latter version is available for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows XP', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
