        <p><strong>Delphi</strong> is an Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SWI'); ?>) for console, desktop graphical, web, and mobile applications.</p>
        <p>Delphi's compilers use their own <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Object Pascal', 'L'); ?> dialect of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Pascal', 'L'); ?> and generate native code for 32 and 64-bit <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> operating systems, as well as 32-bit Mac <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('iOS', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Delphi was originally developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland', 'C'); ?> as a Rapid Application Development (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RAD', 'PMA'); ?>) tool for Windows, and as the successor of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Turbo Pascal', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>In 2006, Borlandâ€™s developer tools section were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary known as <strong>CodeGear</strong>, which was sold to <strong>Embarcadero Technologies</strong> in 2008.</p>
        <p>Borland developer Danny Thorpe suggested the <em>Delphi</em> codename in reference to the <strong>Oracle at Delphi</strong>.</p>
        <p>One of the design goals of the product was to provide database connectivity to programmers as a key feature and a popular database package at the time was <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Oracle', 'DB'); ?> database; hence, "<em>If you want to talk to [the] Oracle, go to Delphi</em>".</p>
