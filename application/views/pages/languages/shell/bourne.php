        <p><strong>The Bourne shell</strong> (sh) is a shell, or command-line interpreter, for computer operating systems.</p>
        <p>The Bourne shell was the default <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> shell of Unix Version 7.</p>
        <p>Most Unix-like systems continue to have <code>/bin/sh</code> which will be the Bourne shell, or a symbolic link or hard link to a compatible shell even when other shells are used by most users.</p>
        <p>Developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Stephen Bourne', 'P'); ?> at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bell Labs', 'C'); ?>, it was a replacement for the <strong>Thompson shell</strong>, whose executable file had the same name sh.</p>
        <p>It was released in 1977 in the Version 7 Unix release distributed to colleges and universities.</p>
        <p>Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was always intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs.</p>
