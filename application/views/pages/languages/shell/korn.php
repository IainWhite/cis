        <p><strong>Korn Shell</strong> (ksh) is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> shell which was developed by David Korn at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bell Labs', 'C'); ?> in the early 1980s and announced at USENIX on 14 July 1983.</p>
        <p>Korn Shell is backward-compatible with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bourne shell', 'LS'); ?> and includes many features of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C shell', 'LS'); ?>, inspired by the requests of Bell Labs users.</p>
