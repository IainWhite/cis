        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Bash Shell'); ?>
        <p><strong>Bash</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Unix', 'OS'); ?> shell written by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Brian Fox', 'P'); ?> for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bourne shell', 'LS'); ?> (sh).</p>
        <p>Released in 1989, it has been distributed widely as the shell for the GNU operating system and as a default shell on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?> and Mac <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It has been ported to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Windows', 'OS'); ?> and distributed with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Gygwin', 'IT'); ?> and MinGW, to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> by the DJGPP project, to {'NetWare'|link_urls:'i'}<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Novell NetWare', 'OS'); ?> and to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Android', 'OS'); ?> via various terminal emulation applications.</p>
        <p>Bash is a command processor, typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands which cause actions. Bash can also read commands from a file, called a script.</p>
        <p>Like all Unix shells, it supports filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.</p>
        <p>The name itself is an acronym, a pun, and a description.</p>
        <p>As an acronym, it stands for Bourne-again shell, referring to its objective as a free replacement for the Bourne shell.</p>
        <p>As a pun, it expressed that objective in a phrase that sounds similar to born again, a term for spiritual rebirth.</p>
        <p>The name is also descriptive of what it did, bashing together the features of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Bourne shell', 'LS'); ?> (sh), <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C shell', 'LS'); ?> (csh), and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Korn shell', 'LS'); ?> (ksh).</p>
