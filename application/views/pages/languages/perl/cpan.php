        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('CPAN - Comprehensive Perl Archive Network'); ?>
        <p><strong>CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</strong>, is an archive of over 129,703 modules of software in 29,092 distributions, written by 11,274 authors, written in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Perl', 'L'); ?> programming language, as well as documentation for them.</p>
        <p>It has a presence on the World Wide Web at <?php echo $this->stencil->addExternalLink('metacpan.org', 'http://metacpan.org'); ?> or via the old interface <?php echo $this->stencil->addExternalLink('www.cpan.org', 'http://www.cpan.org'); ?> and is mirrored worldwide at more than 260 locations.</p>
        <p>CPAN can denote either the archive network itself, or the Perl program that acts as an interface to the network and as an automated software installer (somewhat like a package manager).</p>
        <p>Most software on CPAN is free and open source software. CPAN was conceived in 1993, and the first web-accessible mirror was launched in January 1997.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>The CPAN website:</strong> <?php echo $this->stencil->addExternalLink('metacpan.org', 'http://metacpan.org'); ?></p>
