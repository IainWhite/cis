        <p><strong>BCPL</strong> (<strong>B</strong>asic <strong>C</strong>ombined <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>L</strong>anguage) is a procedural, imperative, and structured computer programming language designed by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge in 1966.</p>
        <p>Originally intended for writing compilers for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use.</p>
        <p>However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?> programming language was based.</p>
        <p>This led many C programmers to give BCPL the humorous backronym <em>Before C Programming Language</em>.</p>
        <p>BCPL was the first brace programming language, and the braces survived the syntactical changes and have become a common means of denoting program source code statements.</p>
        <p>BCPL was a response to difficulties with its predecessor <strong>Combined Programming Language</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CPL', 'L'); ?>), created during the early 1960s.</p>
        <p>Richards created BCPL by "<em>removing those features of the full language which make compilation difficult</em>".</p>
        <p>The first compiler implementation, for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IBM', 'C'); ?> 7094 under Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), was written while Richards was visiting Project MAC at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the spring of 1967.</p>
        <p>The language was first described in a paper presented to the 1969 Spring Joint Computer Conference.</p>
