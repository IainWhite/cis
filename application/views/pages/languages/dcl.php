        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('DCL - DEC Command Language'); ?>
        <p><strong>DCL</strong>, the <strong>DIGITAL Command Language</strong>, is the standard command language adopted by most of the operating systems that were sold by the former Digital Equipment Corporation (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC', 'C'); ?>).</p>
        <p>It had its roots in the IAS, TOPS-20, and RT-11 operating systems and was implemented as a standard across most of Digital's operating systems, notably RSX-11, but took its most powerful form in the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VMS', 'OS'); ?> operating system.</p>
        <p>Written when the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Fortran', 'L'); ?> programming language was in heavy use, DCL is a scripting language supporting several datatypes, including strings, integers, bit arrays, arrays and booleans, but not floating point numbers.</p>
        <p>Access to VMS system services (kernel API) is through lexical functions, which perform the same as their compiled language counterparts and allow scripts to get information on system state.</p>
