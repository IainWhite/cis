        <p><strong>Turbo Basic</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BASIC', 'L'); ?> compiler and dialect originally created by <strong>Robert "Bob" Zale</strong> and bought from him by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Borland', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>When Borland decided to stop publishing it, Zale bought it back from them, renamed it to <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('PowerBasic', 'LB'); ?> and set up <strong>PowerBASIC Inc.</strong> to continue support and development of it.</p>
        <p>Borland's Turbo Basic contains extensions to classical BASIC (while not breaking compatibility). One of those are drawing API, and mouse access.</p>
        <p>Unlike most BASIC implementations of this period, Turbo Basic was a full compiler which generated native code for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('MS DOS', 'OS'); ?>. Other implementations were either interpreters, or relied heavily on a runtime library.</p>
        <p>The Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SWI'); ?>) could run a BASIC program internally for traditional BASIC debugging, or generate an MS-DOS stand-alone executable file that could be run on other systems without the Turbo Basic product or runtime libraries.</p>
