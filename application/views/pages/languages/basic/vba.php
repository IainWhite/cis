        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('VBA - Visual Basic for Applications'); ?>
        <p><strong>Visual Basic for Applications</strong> (<strong>VBA</strong>) is an implementation of Microsoft's event-driven programming language <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visual Basic', 'LB'); ?> 6 and its associated Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SW'); ?>).</p>
        <p>Visual Basic for Applications enables building user-defined functions (UDFs), automating processes and accessing <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows API', 'SD'); ?> and other low-level functionality through dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).</p>
        <p>It supersedes and expands on the abilities of earlier application-specific macro programming languages such as Word's WordBasic.</p>
        <p>It can be used to control many aspects of the host application, including manipulating user interface features, such as menus and toolbars, and working with custom user forms or dialog boxes.</p>
        <p>As its name suggests, VBA is closely related to Visual Basic and uses the Visual Basic Runtime Library, but it can normally only run code within a host application rather than as a standalone program.</p>
        <p>It can, however, be used to control one application from another via OLE Automation.</p>
        <p>VBA has the ability to use (but not create) (ActiveX/COM) DLLs, and later versions add support for class modules.</p>
        <p>VBA is built into most <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Office', 'SW'); ?> applications, including Office for Mac <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('OS X', 'OS'); ?> (apart from version 2008) and other <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> applications such as Microsoft MapPoint and Microsoft <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Visio', 'SW'); ?>, as well as being at least partially implemented in other applications such as ArcGIS, AutoCAD, CATIA and WordPerfect.</p>
