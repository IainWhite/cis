        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('VAX BASIC'); ?>
        <p>With the creation of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VAX', 'ITH'); ?> minicomputer, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DEC', 'C'); ?> ported <strong>BASIC-PLUS-2</strong> to the new <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VMS', 'OS'); ?> operating system, and called it <strong>VAX BASIC</strong>.</p>
        <p>VAX BASIC used the standard VMS calling standards, so object code produced by VAX BASIC could be linked with object code produced by any of the other VMS languages.</p>
        <p>Source code for BASIC Plus 2 would usually run without major changes on VAX BASIC.</p>
        <p>When DEC created their Alpha microprocessor, VMS was ported to it and renamed OpenVMS.</p>
        <p>VAX BASIC was likewise ported to Alpha and renamed DEC BASIC.</p>
        <p>The BASIC interpreter was permanently dropped at this point, which meant that DEC BASIC programs could only be run as OpenVMS executables, produced by a compile followed by a link.</p>
