        <p><strong>PowerBASIC</strong> is the brand of several commercial compilers by PowerBASIC Inc. that compile a dialect of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BASIC', 'L'); ?> programming language.</p>
        <p>There are both <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?> versions, and two kinds of the latter: Console and Windows.</p>
        <p>The DOS version has a syntax similar to that of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('QBasic', 'LB'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('QuickBASIC', 'LB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The Windows versions use a BASIC syntax expanded to include many Windows functions, and the statements can be combined with calls to the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows API', 'IT'); ?>.</p>
