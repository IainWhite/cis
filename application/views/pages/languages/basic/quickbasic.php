        <p><strong>Microsoft QuickBASIC</strong> (also <strong>QB</strong>) is an Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SWI'); ?>) and compiler for the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BASIC', 'L'); ?> programming language that was developed by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?>.</p>
        <p>QuickBASIC runs mainly on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?>, though there was a short-lived version for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Mac OS', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>It is loosely based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GW-BASIC', 'LB'); ?> but adds user-defined types, improved programming structures, better graphics and disk support and a compiler in addition to the interpreter.</p>
        <p>Microsoft marketed QuickBASIC as the introductory level for their BASIC Professional Development System.</p>
