        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Visual Basic'); ?>
        <p><strong>Visual Basic</strong> is a third-generation event-driven programming language and Integrated Development Environment (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SWI'); ?>) from ?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> for its COM programming model first released in 1991.</p>
        <p>Microsoft intends Visual Basic to be relatively easy to learn and use.</p>
        <p>Visual Basic was derived from <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BASIC', 'L'); ?> and enables the rapid application development (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('RAD', 'PM'); ?>) of graphical user interface (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('GUI', 'IT'); ?>) applications, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects, or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of ActiveX controls and objects.</p>
        <p>A programmer can create an application using the components provided by the Visual Basic program itself.</p>
        <p>Over time the community of programmers have developed new third party components, keeping this programming language to modern standards.</p>
        <p>Programs written in Visual Basic can also use the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows API', 'IT'); ?>, which requires external function declarations.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, new third party functions (which are open source) using part <strong>VB6</strong> source code and part embedded machine code, make the Visual Basic 6.0 applications faster than those designed in <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C++', 'L'); ?>.</p>
        <p>The final release was version 6 in 1998 (now known simply as Visual Basic).</p>
        <p>Though Visual Basic 6.0 IDE is unsupported as of 8 April 2008, the Visual Basic team is committed to “It Just Works” compatibility for Visual Basic 6.0 applications on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Vista', 'OS'); ?>, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows Server 2008', 'WIS'); ?> including R2, <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 7', 'OS'); ?>, and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows 8', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>A dialect of Visual Basic, <strong>Visual Basic for Applications</strong> (<?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('VBA', 'LB'); ?>), is used as a macro or scripting language within several <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> applications, including <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft Office', 'SW'); ?>.</p>
