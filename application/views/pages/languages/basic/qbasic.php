        <p><strong>QBasic</strong> (Microsoft <strong>Quick</strong> <strong>B</strong>eginners <strong>A</strong>ll purpose <strong>S</strong>ymbolic <strong>I</strong>nstruction <strong>C</strong>ode) is an <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('IDE', 'SWI'); ?> and interpreter for a variant of the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BASIC', 'L'); ?> programming language which is based on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('QuickBASIC', 'LB'); ?>.</p>
        <p>Code entered into the IDE is compiled to an intermediate form, and this intermediate form is immediately interpreted on demand within the IDE.</p>
        <p>It can run under nearly all versions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('DOS', 'OS'); ?> and <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Windows', 'OS'); ?>, or through DOSBox / DOSEMU, on <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Linux', 'OS'); ?>.</p>
        <p>For its time, QBasic provided a state-of-the-art IDE, including a debugger with features such as on-the-fly expression evaluation and code modification.</p>
        <p>Like QuickBASIC, but unlike earlier versions of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Microsoft', 'C'); ?> BASIC, QBasic is a structured programming language, supporting constructs such as subroutines and while loops.</p>
        <p>Line numbers, a concept often associated with BASIC, are supported for compatibility, but are not considered good form, having been replaced by descriptive line labels.</p>
        <p>QBasic has limited support for user-defined data types (structures), and several primitive types used to contain strings of text or numeric data.</p>
