        <p><strong>Mallard BASIC</strong> is a <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BASIC', 'L'); ?> interpreter for <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('CP/M', 'OS'); ?> written by <strong>Locomotive Software</strong> and supplied with the <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Amstrad PCW', 'ITH'); ?> range of small business computers, the ZX Spectrum +3 version of CP/M Plus, and the Acorn <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('BBC Micro', 'ITH'); ?> Z80 second Processor.</p>
        <p>In the 1980s, it was standard industry practice to bundle a BASIC interpreter with microcomputers, and the PCW followed this practice. While it was primarily a wordprocessor for business use, it was not a dedicated WP: it also ran the CP/M operating system.</p>
