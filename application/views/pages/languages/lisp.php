        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Lisp Programming Language'); ?>
        <p><strong>Lisp</strong> (historically, <strong>LISP</strong>) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized Polish prefix notation.</p>
        <p>Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today; only <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Fortran', 'L'); ?> is older (by one year).</p>
        <p>Like Fortran, Lisp has changed a great deal since its early days, and a number of dialects have existed over its history.</p>
        <p>Today, the most widely known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme.</p>
        <p>Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus.</p>
        <p>It quickly became the favoured programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research.</p>
        <p>As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, and the self-hosting compiler.</p>
        <p>The name <em>LISP</em> derives from "<strong>LIS</strong>t <strong>P</strong>rocessing".</p>
        <p>Linked lists are one of Lisp language's major data structures, and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.</p>
