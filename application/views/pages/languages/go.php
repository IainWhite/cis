        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('Go Programming Language'); ?>
        <p><strong>Go</strong>, also called <strong>golang</strong>, is a programming language initially developed at <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Google', 'C'); ?> in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.</p>
        <p>It is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('C', 'L'); ?>, adding garbage collected memory management, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays and key-value maps, and a large standard library.</p>
