        <?php echo $this->stencil->setHeadline('COBOL'); ?>
        <p><strong>COBOL</strong> is a compiled computer programming language designed for business.</p>
        <p>It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented.</p>
        <p>It was designed in 1959 by the <strong>Conference on Data Systems Languages</strong> (<strong>CODASYL</strong>) and was largely based on previous programming language design work by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('Grace Hopper', 'P'); ?>.</p>
        <p>COBOL stands for <strong>CO</strong>mmon <strong>B</strong>usiness-<strong>O</strong>riented <strong>L</strong>anguage.</p>
        <p>COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Gartner Group estimated that there were a total of 200 billion lines of COBOL in existence which ran 80% of all business programs.</p>
        <p>COBOL was one of the first programming languages to be standardised: the first COBOL standard was issued by <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ANSI', 'C'); ?> in 1968. The standard has been revised three times since then, with <?php echo $this->stencil->addLink('ISO', 'C'); ?> publishing the latest standard as ISO/IEC 1989:2002.</p>
