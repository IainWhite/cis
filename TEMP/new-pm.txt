Test Management Approach (TMap)
Test management approach (TMap) is a software testing approach. TMap is an approach that combines insights on how to test and what to manage, as well as techniques for the individual test consultant.

The first method was created in 1995 and written by Martin Pol, Ruud Teunissen en Erik van Veenendaal. At the end of 2006 a new version was published called TMap Next written by other authors (Tim Koomen, Michiel Vroon, Leo van der Aalst & Bart Broekman). The main reason for this new version was the aim to create a more process focused description of the test process and put more emphasis on the business objectives as a guidance for the testing process.

TMap was created by the Dutch division of Sogeti which is part of Capgemini.

Quality Management System (QMS)
A Quality Management System (QMS) is a collection of business processes focused on achieving quality policy and quality objectives to meet customer requirements. It is expressed as the organisational structure, policies, procedures, processes and resources needed to implement quality management. Early systems emphasised predictable outcomes of an industrial product production line, using simple statistics and random sampling. By the 20th century, labour inputs were typically the most costly inputs in most industrialized societies, so focus shifted to team cooperation and dynamics, especially the early signalling of problems via a continuous improvement cycle. In the 21st century, QMS has tended to converge with sustainability and transparency initiatives, as both investor and customer satisfaction and perceived quality is increasingly tied to these factors. Of all QMS regimes, the ISO 9000 family of standards is probably the most widely implemented worldwide - the ISO 19011 audit regime applies to both, and deals with quality and sustainability and their integration.

Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
A Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) is a tool for analysing, documenting and communicating the outcomes of a project, and forms part of the product based planning technique.

The PBS provides an exhaustive, hierarchical tree structure of deliverables (physical, functional or conceptual) that make up the project, arranged in whole-part relationship.

This diagrammatic representation of project outputs provides a clear and unambiguous statement of what the project is to deliver.

The PBS is identical in format to the [Work Breakdown Structure] (WBS), but is a separate entity and is used at a different step in the planning process. The PBS precedes the WBS and focuses on cataloguing all the desired outputs (products) needed to achieve the goal of the project. This feeds into creation of the WBS, which identifies the tasks and activities required to deliver those outputs. Supporters of product based planning suggest that this overcomes difficulties that arise from assumptions about what to do and how to do it by focusing instead on the goals and objectives of the project - an oft-quoted analogy is that PBS defines where you want to go, the WBS tells you how to get there.

Object-Modeling Technique (OMT) 
The Object-Modeling Technique (OMT) is an object modeling approach for software modeling and designing. It was developed around 1991 by Rumbaugh, Blaha, Premerlani, Eddy and Lorensen as a method to develop object-oriented systems and to support object-oriented programming. Describes Object model or static structure of the system.

OMT was developed as an approach to software development. The purposes of modeling according to Rumbaugh are:

- testing physical entities before building them (simulation),
- communication with customers,
- visualisation (alternative presentation of information), and
- reduction of complexity.

OMT has proposed three main types of models:

Object model: The object model represents the static and most stable phenomena in the modeled domain. Main concepts are classes and associations with attributes and operations. Aggregation and generalisation (with multiple inheritance) are predefined relationships.

Dynamic model: The dynamic model represents a state / transition view on the model. Main concepts are states, transitions between states, and events to trigger transitions. Actions can be modeled as occurring within states. Generalisation and aggregation (concur-rency) are predefined relationships.

Functional model: The functional model handles the process perspective of the model, corresponding roughly to data flow diagrams. Main concepts are process, data store, data flow, and actors.

OMT is a predecessor of the [Unified Modeling Language] (UML). Many OMT modeling elements are common to UML.

Event Chain Methodology
Event Chain Methodology is an uncertainty modeling and schedule network analysis technique that is focused on identifying and managing events and event chains that affect project schedules. Event chain methodology is the next advance beyond [critical path method] and critical chain project management.

Event chain methodology helps to mitigate the effect of motivational and cognitive biases in estimating and scheduling.

Earned Value Management (EVM)
Earned value management (EVM), or Earned value project / performance management (EVPM) is a project management technique for measuring project performance and progress in an objective manner.

Earned value management is a project management technique for measuring project performance and progress. It has the ability to combine measurements of the project management triangle:

- Scope
- Schedule, and
- Costs

In a single integrated system, Earned Value Management is able to provide accurate forecasts of project performance problems, which is an important contribution for project management.

Early EVM research showed that the areas of planning and control are significantly impacted by its use; and similarly, using the methodology improves both scope definition as well as the analysis of overall project performance. More recent research studies have shown that the principles of EVM are positive predictors of project success. Popularity of EVM has grown in recent years beyond government contracting, in which sector its importance continues to rise in part because EVM can also surface in and help substantiate contract disputes.

Essential features of any EVM implementation include

- a project plan that identifies work to be accomplished,
- a valuation of planned work, called Planned Value (PV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), and
- pre-defined “earning rules” (also called metrics) to quantify the accomplishment of work, called Earned Value (EV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP).

EVM implementations for large or complex projects include many more features, such as indicators and forecasts of cost performance (over budget or under budget) and schedule performance (behind schedule or ahead of schedule). However, the most basic requirement of an EVM system is that it quantifies progress using PV and EV.
