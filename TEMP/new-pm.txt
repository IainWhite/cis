POSIX
POSIX an acronym for Portable Operating System Interface, is a family of standards specified by the [IEEE Computer Society] for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of [Unix] and other operating systems.

Yum - Yellowdog Updater, Modified
The Yellowdog Updater, Modified (yum) is an open-source command-line package-management utility for [Linux] operating systems using the [RPM] Package Manager. Though yum has a command-line interface, several other tools provide graphical user interfaces to yum functionality.

Yum allows automatic updates, package and dependency management, on RPM-based distributions. Like the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) from [Debian], yum works with software repositories (collections of packages), which can be accessed locally or over a network connection.

Under the hood, yum depends on RPM, which is a packaging standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digisigs to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither yum nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by endusers. Yum is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as Yum Extender (yumex) also exist. A rewrite of yum based on libsolv named DNF is currently being developed and expected to replace yum as the default package manager in Fedora 22.

RPM Package Manager 
RPM Package Manager (RPM) (originally Red Hat Package Manager; now a recursive initialism) is a package management system. The name RPM variously refers to the .rpm file format, files in this format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager itself. RPM was intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base.

Even though it was created for use in Red Hat Linux, RPM is now used in many GNU/Linux distributions. It has also been ported to some other operating systems, such as Novell NetWare (as of version 6.5 SP3) and IBM's AIX (as of version 4).

PhpStorm
JetBrains PhpStorm is a commercial, cross-platform [IDE] for [PHP] built on JetBrains' [IntelliJ IDEA] platform.

PhpStorm provides an editor for [PHP], [HTML] and [JavaScript] with on-the-fly code analysis, error prevention and automated refactorings for PHP and JavaScript code. PhpStorm's code completion supports PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 &amp; 5.6 (modern and legacy projects), including generators, coroutines, the finally keyword, list in foreach, namespaces, closures, traits and short array syntax. It includes a full-fledged [SQL] editor with editable query results.

PhpStorm is built on IntelliJ IDEA, which is written in [Java]. Users can extend the IDE by installing plugins created for the IntelliJ Platform or write their own plugins.

All features available in [WebStorm] are included in PhpStorm, which adds support for PHP and databases. WebStorm ships with pre-installed JavaScript plugins (such as for [Node.js]), which are available for PhpStorm as well at no cost.

IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ IDEA is a [Java] integrated development environment ([IDE]) for developing computer software. It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ), and is available as an [Apache 2 Licensed] community edition, and in a proprietary commercial edition. IntelliJ IDEA is not based on [Eclipse] like MyEclipse or Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse.

The first version of IntelliJ IDEA was released in January 2001, and at the time was one of the first available Java IDE with advanced code navigation and code refactoring capabilities integrated.

In a 2010 Infoworld report, IntelliJ received the highest test center score out of the four top Java programming tools: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, [NetBeans] and Oracle JDeveloper.

In December 2014, [Google] announced version 1.0 of [Android Studio], an open source IDE for Android apps, based on the open source community edition of IntelliJ IDEA. Other development environments based on IntelliJ include AppCode, [PhpStorm], PyCharm, RubyMine, [WebStorm], and MPS.

WebStorm
JetBrains WebStorm is a commercial [IDE] for [JavaScript], [CSS] &amp; [HTML] built on JetBrains' [IntelliJ IDEA] platform. WebStorm is a specialised version of [PhpStorm], offering a subset of its features. WebStorm ships with pre-installed JavaScript plugins (such as for [Node.js]), which are available for PhpStorm as well at no cost.

WebStorm provides automatic code completion, on-the-fly code analysis, refactoring support and VCS integration. Supported languages are JavaScript, [CoffeeScript], [TypeScript] and [Dart].

Sublime Text
Sublime Text is a cross-platform text and source code editor with a [Python] application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.

Sublime Text is proprietary software. Despite users enhancing the software with free add-ons, all license revenue accrues to the primary developer.

Hello, World!
A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs "Hello, World!" (or some variant thereof) on a display device. Because it is typically one of the simplest programs possible in most programming languages, it is by tradition often used to illustrate to beginners the most basic syntax of a programming language. It is also used to verify that a language or system is operating correctly.

Software Metric
A software metric is a quantitative measure of a degree to which a software system or process possesses some property. Since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences, there is a continuous effort by computer science practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development. The goal is obtaining objective, reproducible and quantifiable measurements, which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning, cost estimation, quality assurance testing, software debugging, software performance optimisation, and optimal personnel task assignments.

Gentoo Linux
Gentoo Linux is a computer operating system based on the [Linux] kernel and built using the Portage package management system. It is distributed as free and open-source software. Unlike a binary software distribution, the source code is compiled locally according to the user's preferences and is often optimised for the specific type of computer. Precompiled binaries are available for some very large packages and for packages whose source code has not been released.

The "Gentoo" name comes from the fast-swimming Gentoo penguin. It was chosen to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine-specific optimisation. Gentoo package management is designed to be modular, portable, easy to maintain, and flexible. Gentoo is sometimes described as a meta-distribution, "because of its near unlimited adaptability", in that the majority of users have configurations and sets of installed programs which are unique to themselves.

OpenWrt
OpenWrt is an operating system (in particular, an embedded operating system) based on the [Linux] kernel, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic. The main components are the Linux kernel, util-linux, uClibc or musl and BusyBox. All components have been optimised for size, to be small enough for fitting into the limited storage and memory available in home routers.

OpenWrt is configured using a command-line interface (ash shell), or a web interface (LuCI). There are about 3500 optional software packages available for installation via the opkg package management system.

OpenWrt can run on various types of devices, including CPE routers, residential gateways, smartphones (e.g. Neo FreeRunner), pocket computers (e.g. Ben NanoNote), and laptops (e.g. [One Laptop per Child] (OLPC)). It is also possible to run OpenWrt on ordinary computers, which are most commonly based on the x86 architecture. Many patches from the OpenWrt's codebase have been included upstream in the Linux kernel mainline.

Intel 80186
The Intel 80186, also known as the iAPX 186, or just 186, is a microprocessor and microcontroller introduced in 1982. It was based on the [Intel 8086] and, like it, had a 16-bit external data bus multiplexed with a 20-bit address bus. It was also available as the 80188, with an 8-bit external data bus.
