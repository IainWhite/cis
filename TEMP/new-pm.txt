AWStats
AWStats is an open source Web analytics reporting tool, suitable for analysing data from Internet services such as web, streaming media, mail, and FTP servers. AWStats parses and analyses server log files, producing [HTML] reports. Data is visually presented within reports by tables and bar graphs. Static reports can be created through a command line interface, and on-demand reporting is supported through a Web browser [CGI] program.

AWStats supports most major web server log file formats including [Apache] (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or Common Log Format (CLF)), WebStar, [IIS] (W3C log format), and many other common web server log formats. Developers can contribute to the AWStats project through [SourceForge.net].

Moodle
Moodle is a free and open-source software learning management system written in [PHP] and distributed under the [GNU General Public License]. Developed on pedagogical principles, Moodle is used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other e-learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors.

With customisable management features, it is used to create private websites with online courses for educators and trainers to achieve learning goals. Moodle (acronym for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment) allows for extending and tailoring learning environments using community sourced plugins.

Bugzilla
Bugzilla is a web based general purpose bug tracker and testing tool originally developed and used by the [Mozilla] project, and licensed under the [Mozilla Public License].

Bugzilla was originally written by Terry Weissman in 1998 for the nascent Mozilla.org project, as an open source application to replace the in-house system then in use at [Netscape Communications] for tracking defects in the [Netscape Communicator] suite. Originally written in [Tcl], Terry decided to port Bugzilla to [Perl] before its release as part of Netscape's early open source code drops, with the hopes that more people would be able to contribute to it as Perl seemed to be a more popular language at the time.

Bugzilla 2.0 was the result of that port to [Perl], and the first version released to the public via anonymous CVS. In April 2000, Weissman handed off control of the Bugzilla project to Tara Hernandez. Under Tara's leadership, some of the regular contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility, and Bugzilla development became more community driven. In July 2001, facing distraction from her other responsibilities in Netscape, Tara handed off control to Dave Miller, who was still in charge as of 2013.

Bugzilla 3.0 was released on May 10, 2007 and brought refreshed UI, XML-RPC interface, custom fields and resolutions, mod_perl support, shared saved searches, improved UTF-8 support and others.

Bugzilla 4.0 was released on 15 February 2011.

Mercurial
Mercurial is a cross-platform, distributed revision control tool for software developers. It is mainly implemented using the [Python] programming language, but includes a binary diff implementation written in [C]. It is supported on [MS Windows] and [Unix-like] systems, such as [FreeBSD], [Mac OS X] and [Linux]. Mercurial is primarily a command line program but graphical user interface extensions are available. All of Mercurial's operations are invoked as arguments to its driver program hg, a reference to the chemical symbol of the element mercury.

Mercurial's major design goals include high performance and scalability, decentralised, fully distributed collaborative development, robust handling of both plain text and binary files, and advanced branching and merging capabilities, while remaining conceptually simple. It includes an integrated web interface. Mercurial has also taken steps to ease the transition for [SVN] users.

The creator and lead developer of Mercurial is Matt Mackall. Mercurial is released as free software under the terms of the [GNU GPL v2] (or any later version).

Unity
Unity is a graphical shell for the [GNOME desktop environment] developed by Canonical Ltd. for its [Ubuntu] operating system. Unity debuted in the netbook edition of Ubuntu 10.10. It was initially designed to make more efficient use of space given the limited screen size of netbooks, including, for example, a vertical application switcher called the launcher, and a space saving horizontal multipurpose top menu bar.

Unlike [GNOME], [KDE Software Compilation], [Xfce], or [LXDE], Unity is not a collection of applications but is designed to use existing programs.

Cinnamon
Cinnamon is a desktop environment that is based on the [GTK+] 3 toolkit. It was released in 2011. The project was originally started as a fork of the [GNOME Shell], i.e. a mere graphical shell, but became its own desktop environment in Cinnamon 2.0. Cinnamon was initially developed by (and for) the Linux distribution [Linux Mint].

Because the Cinnamon desktop environment intends to implement a different graphical user interface ([GUI]) than the GNOME desktop environment, many of the GNOME Core Applications were forked, so that their GUIs can be rewritten appropriately.

Suger
Sugar is a free and open source desktop environment designed with the goal of being used by children for interactive learning. Developed as part of the [One Laptop per Child] (OLPC) project, Sugar was the default interface on OLPC XO-1 laptop computers. The OLPC XO-1.5 and later provided the option of either the Gnome or Sugar interfaces.

Sugar is available as a Live CD, as Live USB, a package installable through several [Linux] distributions, or on [Windows] and [Mac OS] through virtualisation.

Since May 2008, Sugar has been developed under the umbrella of Sugar Labs, a member project of the Software Freedom Conservancy. Sugar is open-source software under the [GNU GPL license],;[1] many of Sugar Labs' contributors are volunteers.

Unlike most other desktop environments, Sugar does not use the "desktop", "folder" and "window" metaphors. Instead, Sugar's default full-screen activities require users to focus on only one program at a time. Sugar implements a journal which automatically saves the user's running program session and allows him or her to later use an interface to pull up their past works by date, activity used or file type.
