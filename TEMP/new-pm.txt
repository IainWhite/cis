Base64
Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an [ASCII] string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The term Base64 originates from a specific [MIME] content transfer encoding.

Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that is designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during transport. Base64 is commonly used in a number of applications, including email via MIME, and storing complex data in [XML].

WebGL
WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a [JavaScript] API for rendering interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL is integrated completely into all the web standards of the browser allowing GPU accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas. WebGL elements can be mixed with other [HTML] elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background. WebGL programs consist of control code written in JavaScript and shader code that is executed on a computer's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). WebGL is designed and maintained by the non-profit Khronos Group.

Google Panda
Google Panda is a change to [Google]'s search results ranking algorithm that was first released in February 2011. The change aimed to lower the rank of "low-quality sites" or "thin sites", and return higher quality sites near the top of the search results. CNET reported a surge in the rankings of news websites and social networking sites, and a drop in rankings for sites containing large amounts of advertising. This change reportedly affected the rankings of almost 12 percent of all search results. Soon after the Panda rollout, many websites, including Google's webmaster forum, became filled with complaints of scrapers / copyright infringers getting better rankings than sites with original content. At one point, Google publicly asked for data points to help detect scrapers better. Google's Panda has received several updates since the original rollout in February 2011, and the effect went global in April 2011. To help affected publishers, Google provided an advisory on its blog, thus giving some direction for self-evaluation of a website's quality. Google has provided a list of 23 bullet points on its blog answering the question of "What counts as a high-quality site?" that is supposed to help webmasters "step into Google's mindset".

Google Panda is a filter that prevents low quality sites and / or pages from ranking well in the search engine results page. The filter's threshold is influenced by Google Quality Raters. Quality Raters answer questions such as "would I trust this site with my credit card?" so that Google can distinguish the difference between high and low quality sites.

The Google Panda patent (patent 8,682,892), filed on 28 September 2012, was granted on 25 March 2014. The patent states that Google Panda creates a ratio with a site's inbound links and reference queries, search queries for the site's brand. That ratio is then used to create a sitewide modification factor. The sitewide modification factor is then used to create a modification factor for a page based upon a search query. If the page fails to meet a certain threshold, the modification factor is applied and, therefore, the page would rank lower in the search engine results page.

Google Panda affects the ranking of an entire site or a specific section rather than just the individual pages on a site.

In March 2012, Google updated Panda.

Google says it only takes a few pages of poor quality or duplicated content to hold down traffic on an otherwise solid site, and recommends such pages be removed, blocked from being indexed by the search engine, or rewritten. However, Matt Cutts, head of webspam at Google, warns that rewriting duplicate content so that it is original may not be enough to recover from Panda, the rewrites must be of sufficiently high quality, as such content brings "additional value" to the web. Content that is general, non-specific, and not substantially different from what is already out there should not be expected to rank well: "Those other sites are not bringing additional value. While they’re not duplicates they bring nothing new to the table."

Google Penalty 
A Google penalty is the negative impact on a website's search rankings based on updates to [Google]'s search algorithms and / or manual review. The penalty can be an unfortunate by-product of an algorithm update or an intentional penalisation for various black-hat SEO techniques.

Google penalises sites for engaging in practices that are against its webmaster guidelines. These penalties can be the result of a manual review or algorithm updates such as [Google Penguin].

Google penalties can result in the drop of rankings for every page of a site, for a specific keyword, or for a specific page. Any drop in rankings brings with it a major drop in traffic for the site.

To find out if a website has been affected by a Google penalty, website owners can use Google Webmaster Tools as well as analyse the timing of their traffic drop with the timing of known Google updates.

Google has been updating its algorithm for as long as it has been fighting the manipulation of organic search results. However, up until May 10, 2012, when Google launched the Google Penguin update, many people wrongly believed that low-quality backlinks would not negatively affect ranks. While this viewpoint was common, it was not correct, as Google had been applying such link-based penalties for many years, but not made public how the company approached and dealt with what they called "link spam". Since this time there has been a much wider acknowledgement about the dangers of bad [SEO] and a forensic analysis of backlinks to ensure there are no harmful links.

Google Penguin
Google Penguin is a codename for a [Google] algorithm update that was first announced on 24 April 2012. The update is aimed at decreasing search engine rankings of websites that violate Google’s Webmaster Guidelines by using now declared black-hat SEO techniques involved in increasing artificially the ranking of a webpage by manipulating the number of links pointing to the page. Such tactics are commonly described as link schemes. According to Google's John Mueller, Google has announced all updates to the Penguin filter to the public.

By Google’s estimates, Penguin affects approximately 3.1% of search queries in English, about 3% of queries in languages like German, Chinese, and Arabic, and an even bigger percentage of them in "highly spammed" languages. On 25 May 2012, Google unveiled another Penguin update, called Penguin 1.1. This update, according to Matt Cutts, was supposed to affect less than one-tenth of a percent of English searches. The guiding principle for the update was to penalise websites using manipulative techniques to achieve high rankings. The purpose per Google was to catch excessive spammers. Allegedly, few websites lost search rankings on Google for specific keywords during the Panda and Penguin rollouts. Google specifically mentions that doorway pages, which are only built to attract search engine traffic, are against their webmaster guidelines.

In January 2012, the so-called Page Layout Algorithm Update (also known as the Top Heavy Update) was released, which targeted websites with too many ads, or too little content above the fold.

Penguin 3 was released 5 October 2012 and affected 0.3% of queries. Penguin 4 (AKA Penguin 2.0) was released on 22 May 2013 and affected 2.3% of queries. Penguin 5 (AKA Penguin 2.1) was released on 4 October 2013, affected around 1% of queries, and has been the most recent of the Google Penguin algorithm updates.

Spamdexing
In computing, spamdexing (also known as search engine spam, search engine poisoning, Black-Hat SEO, search spam or web spam) is the deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes. It involves a number of methods, such as repeating unrelated phrases, to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of the indexing system. It could be considered to be a part of [search engine optimisation], though there are many search engine optimisation methods that improve the quality and appearance of the content of web sites and serve content useful to many users. Search engines use a variety of algorithms to determine relevancy ranking. Some of these include determining whether the search term appears in the body text or URL of a web page. Many search engines check for instances of spamdexing and will remove suspect pages from their indexes. Also, people working for a search-engine organisation can quickly block the results listing from entire websites that use spamdexing, perhaps alerted by user complaints of false matches. The rise of spamdexing in the mid 1990s made the leading search engines of the time less useful. Using unethical methods to make websites rank higher in search engine results than they otherwise would is commonly referred to in the SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) industry as "Black Hat SEO."

Common spamdexing techniques can be classified into two broad classes: content spam (or term spam) and link spam.

Google Hummingbird
Google Hummingbird is a search algorithm used by [Google].

Google started using Hummingbird about 30 August 2013, and announced the change on 26 September on the eve of the company's 15th anniversary.

Gianluca Fiorelli said Hummingbird is about synonyms but also about context. Google always had synonyms, he writes, but with Hummingbird it is also able to judge context - thereby judging the intent of a person carrying out a search, to determine what they are trying to find out. This concept is called semantic search.

Danny Sullivan said of Hummingbird, "Google said that Hummingbird is paying more attention to each word in a query, ensuring that the whole query — the whole sentence or conversation or meaning — is taken into account." Michelle Hill said Hummingbird is about "understanding intent". Steve Masters wrote, "The Hummingbird approach should be inspirational to anyone managing and planning content — if you aren't already thinking like Hummingbird, you should be. In a nutshell, think about why people are looking for something rather than what they are looking for. A content strategy should be designed to answer their needs, not just provide them with facts".

The Hummingbird update was the first major update to Google's search algorithm since the 2010 “Caffeine Update”, but even that was limited primarily to improving the indexing of information rather than the sorting of information. Google search chief Amit Singhal stated that Hummingbird is the first major update of its type since 2001.

Conversational search leverages natural language, semantic search, and more to improve the way search queries are parsed. Unlike previous search algorithms which would focus on each individual word in the search query, Hummingbird considers each word but also how each word makes up the entirety of the query — the whole sentence or conversation or meaning — is taken into account, rather than particular words. The goal is that pages matching the meaning do better, rather than pages matching just a few words.

Much like an extension of Google's "Knowledge Graph", Hummingbird is aimed at making interactions more human — capable of understanding the concepts and relationships between keywords.

Hummingbird places greater emphasis on page content making search results more relevant and pertinent and ensuring that Google delivers users to the most appropriate page of a website, rather than to a home page or top level page.

Sixel
Sixel, short for "six pixels", is a bitmap graphics format supported by terminals and printers from [DEC]. It consists of a pattern six pixels high and one wide, resulting in 63 possible patterns. Each possible pattern is assigned an [ASCII] character, making the sixels easy to transmit on 7-bit serial links.

Sixel was first introduced as a way of sending bitmap graphics to DEC dot matrix printers like the LA50. After being put into "sixel mode" the following data was interpreted to directly control six of the pins in the nine pin print head. A string of sixel characters encodes a single 6 pixel high row of the image.

The system was later re-used as a way to send bitmap data to the [VT200] series terminals as a way to define custom character sets. A number of sixels were used to define each character. Starting with the [VT300] series, the terminals could decode a complete sixel image to the screen, like those previously sent to printers.

Sixel encodes images by breaking up the bitmap into a series of 6 pixel high horizontal strips. Each 1 pixel wide vertical column in a particular strip forms a single sixel. Each sixel's pixels are read as binary and encoded into a single 6 bit number, with "on" pixels encoded as a 1. This number, from 0 to 63 decimal, is then converted into a single ASCII character, offset by 63 so that an all-black sixel, 0 decimal, is encoded as ?. This ensures that the sixels remain within the easily printable range of the character set. Carriage return (CR) is represented by $, and line feeds (LF) with a -, both had to be sent in turn to return the cursor to the start of the line, CRLF.

Sixel also included a rudimentary form of compression, using Run Length Encoding ([RLE]). This was accomplished with the ! character followed by a decimal number of the times to repeat, and then a single sixel character to be repeated. Since the ! and decimal digits could not be valid sixel data, lying outside the encoded range, the encoding was easy to identify and expand back out in software.

"Sixel mode" was entered by sending the sequence <ESC>Pp1;p2;p3;q. The p1 through p3 were optional setup parameters, with p1 defining an aspect ratio (deprecated in favor of p3), p2 how to interpret the color of zeros, and p3 with simple grid size parameters. <ESC>P is the standard DEC "Device Control String", or DCS, which was used to turn on or off a number of special features in DEC's equipment. The "q" is the sixel identifier. Sixel data then followed the q. The "Stop Text" sequence <ESC>\ returned the device back to normal character mode again.

For printing, sixels are sent to the printer, decoded back into binary, and sent directly to the six pins of the print head. The only complexity involved expanding the RLE's into the internal print buffer. Display on a terminal is somewhat more difficult. On terminals supporting graphics, the [ReGIS] graphics system was used to directly draw the sixel pattern into the screen's bitmap. This was done at high speed by storing the bitmap patterns as a glyph and then bitting them.

When used for defining custom character sets the format was almost identical, although the escape codes changed. In terms of the data, the only major difference was the replacement of the separate CR/LF with a single /. In the VT300 series for instance, 80-column character glyphs were 15 pixels wide by 12 high, meaning that a character could be defined by sending a total of 30 sixels.

Colour was also supported using the # character, followed by a number referring to one of a number of colour registers, which varied from device to device. Colours were defined using either [RGB] or [HSV] values in a peculiar DEC format. On a printer, a line of sixels was sent several times, each representing a single bitplane from the register based colours on the terminals (normally 2 or 4 bits). For non-graphics terminals, colour was simply dropped. Since the capabilities of the hardware varied widely, a colour sixel drawing could only be output to targeted devices.

Run Length Encoding (RLE) 
Run Length Encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs. Consider, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, and animations. It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could greatly increase the file size.

RLE may also be used to refer to an early graphics file format supported by [CompuServe] for compressing black and white images, but was widely supplanted by their later [Graphics Interchange Format]. RLE also refers to a little used image format in [Windows 3.x], with the extension .rle, which is a Run Length Encoded Bitmap, used to compress the Windows 3.x startup screen.

Typical applications of this encoding are when the source information comprises long substrings of the same character or binary digit.
===

ANSI Escape Codes
In computing, ANSI escape codes (or escape sequences) are a method using in-band signaling to control the formatting, colour, and other output options on video text terminals. To encode this formatting information, certain sequences of bytes are embedded into the text, which the terminal looks for and interprets as commands, not as character codes.

ANSI codes were introduced in the 1970s and became widespread in the minicomputer / mainframe market by the early 1980s. They were used by the nascent [bulletin board system] market to offer improved displays compared to earlier systems lacking cursor movement, leading to even more widespread use.

Although hardware text terminals have become increasingly rare in the 21st century, the relevance of the ANSI standard persists because most terminal emulators interpret at least some of the ANSI escape sequences in the output text. One notable exception is the win32 console component of [Microsoft Windows].
===

Mac Terminal
Terminal (Terminal.app) is the terminal emulator included in the [OS X] operating system by [Apple].

Terminal originated in [NeXTSTEP] and OPENSTEP, the predecessor operating systems of OS X.

As a terminal emulator, the application provides text-based access to the operating system, in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience of OS X, by providing a command line interface to the operating system when used in conjunction with a [Unix] shell, such as [bash].

The preferences dialog for Terminal.app in OS X 10.8 ([Mountain Lion]) offers choices for values of the TERM environment variable. Available options are ansi, dtterm, nsterm, rxvt, vt52, vt100, vt102, xterm, xterm-16color and xterm-256color, which differ from the OS X 10.5 ([Leopard]) choices by dropping the xterm-color and adding xterm-16color and xterm-256color. These settings do not alter the operation of Terminal, and the xterm settings do not match the behaviour of xterm.

Terminal includes several features that specifically access OS X APIs and features. These include the ability to use the standard OS X Help search function to find manual pages and integration with Spotlight. Terminal was used by Apple as a showcase for OS X graphics APIs in early advertising of Mac OS X, offering a range of custom font and colouring options, including transparent backgrounds.

National Replacement Character Set
The National Replacement Character Set, or NRCS for short, was a feature supported by later models of Digital's ([DEC]) computer terminal systems, starting with the [VT200] series in 1983. NRCS allowed individual characters from one character set to be replaced by one from another set, allowing the construction of different character sets on the fly. It was used to customize the character set to different local languages, without having to change the terminal's [ROM] for different counties, or alternately, include many different sets in a larger ROM. Many 3rd party terminals and terminal emulators supporting VT200 codes also supported NRCS.

[ASCII] is a 7-bit standard, allowing a total of 128 characters in the character set. Some of these are reserved as control characters, leaving 96 printable characters. This set of 96 includes upper and lower case letters, numbers, and basic math and punctuation.

ASCII does not have enough room to include other common characters such as multi-national currency symbols or the various accented letters common in European languages. This led to a number of country specific varieties of 7-bit ASCII with certain characters replaced. For instance, the UK standard simply replaced ASCII's hash mark, #, with the pound symbol, £. This normally led to different models of a given computer terminal or printer, differing only in the [glyphs] stored in ROM. These were standardised as part of ISO/IEC 646.

On an [8-bit clean] serial link, ASCII can be expanded to support a total of 256 characters. In this case, instead of replacing the characters in the original printable characters range from 32 to 127, new characters are added in the 128 to 255 range. This offers enough room for a single character set to include all the variety of characters used in North America and western Europe. This capability led to the introduction of the ISO/IEC 8859-1 standard character set containing 191 characters of what it calls the "Latin alphabet no. 1", but normally referred to as "ISO Latin". [Windows-1252] is a slightly expanded superset of ISO Latin.

NRCS was introduced to solve the problem of requiring different terminals for each country by allowing characters in the basic 7-bit ASCII set to be re-defined by copying the glyph from the DEC's version of ISO Latin, the [Multinational Character Set] (MCS). This meant that the ROM had to store only two character sets, standard ASCII and MCS, and could build any required local ASCII variant on the fly. For instance, instead of having a separate "UK ASCII" version of the terminal with a modified glyph in ROM, the terminal included an NRCS with instructions to replace the hash mark glyph with the pound. When used in the UK, typing Shift 3 produced the pound, the same keys pressed on a US terminal produced hash.

The NRCS could be set through a setup command, or more commonly, by replacing the keyboard with a model that sent back a code when first booted. That way simply plugging in a UK keyboard, which had a pound sign on the 3 key, automatically set the NRSC to that same replacement.
===

Multinational Character Set (MCS)
The Multinational Character Set (MCS) is a character encoding created by [Digital Equipment Corporation] for use in the popular [VT220] terminal. It was an [8-bit] extension of ASCII that added accented characters, currency symbols, and other character [glyphs] missing from 7-bit [ASCII]. It is only one of the code pages implemented for the VT220 [National Replacement Character Set].

Such "[extended ASCII]" sets were common (the National Replacement Character Set provided sets for more than a dozen European languages), but MCS has the distinction of being the ancestor of both [ISO 8859-1] and [Unicode].
===

Extended ASCII
Extended ASCII (or high ASCII) is [8-bit] or larger character encodings that include the standard 7-bit [ASCII] characters as well as others. The use of the term is sometimes criticised, because it can be mistakenly interpreted that the ASCII standard has been updated to include more than 128 characters or that the term unambiguously identifies a single encoding, both of which are untrue.
===

Glyph
In typography, a glyph is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of symbols, intended to represent a readable character for the purposes of writing and thereby expressing thoughts, ideas and concepts. As such, glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word, or otherwise contribute to a specific meaning of what is written, with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage.

For example, in most languages written in any variety of the Latin alphabet the dot on a lower-case i is not a glyph because it does not convey any distinction, and an i in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognised correctly. In Turkish, however, it is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter i, with and without a dot.

In Japanese syllabaries, a number of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark, but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves. However, in some cases, additional marks fulfil the role of diacritics, to differentiate distinct characters. Such additional marks constitute glyphs.

In general, a diacritic is a glyph, even if (like a cedilla in French, the ogonek in several languages or the stroke on a Polish "Ł") it is "joined up" with the rest of the character.

Some characters, such as "æ" in Icelandic and the "ß" in German, would probably be regarded as glyphs: they were originally ligatures but over time have become characters in their own right, and these languages treat them as separate letters. However, a ligature such as "ſi", which is treated in some typefaces as a single unit, is arguably not a glyph as this is just a quirk of the typeface, essentially an allographic feature, and includes more than one grapheme. In normal handwriting, even long words are often written "joined up", without the pen leaving the paper, and the form of each written letter will often vary depending on which letters precede and follow it, but that does not make the whole word into a single glyph.

Two or more glyphs which have the same significance, whether used interchangeably or chosen depending on context, are called allographs of each other.
===

8-bit Clean
8-bit clean describes a computer system that correctly handles [8-bit] character encodings, such as the [ISO 8859] series and the [UTF-8] encoding of [Unicode].

Up to the early 1990s, many programs and data transmission channels assumed that all characters would be represented as numbers between 0 and 127 (7 bits). On computers and data links using 8-bit bytes this left the top bit of each byte free for use as a parity, flag bit, or meta data control bit. 7-bit systems and data links are unable to handle more complex character codes which are commonplace in non-English speaking countries with larger alphabets.

Binary files cannot be transmitted through 7-bit data channels directly. To work around this, binary-to-text encodings have been devised which use only 7-bit [ASCII] characters. Some of these encodings are uuencoding, Ascii85, SREC, BinHex, kermit and [MIME]'s [Base64]. EBCDIC-based systems cannot handle all characters used in UUencoded data. However, the base64 encoding does not have this problem.
===

RS-232
In telecommunications, RS-232 is a standard for serial communication transmission of data. It formally defines the signals connecting between a DTE (data terminal equipment) such as a computer terminal, and a DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment, originally defined as data communication equipment), such as a modem. The RS-232 standard is commonly used in computer serial ports. The standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals, the meaning of signals, and the physical size and pinout of connectors. The current version of the standard is TIA-232-F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange, issued in 1997.

An RS-232 serial port was once a standard feature of a personal computer, used for connections to [modems], printers, mice, data storage, uninterruptible power supplies, and other peripheral devices. However, RS-232 is hampered by low transmission speed, large voltage swing, and large standard connectors. In modern personal computers, [USB] has displaced RS-232 from most of its peripheral interface roles. Many computers do not come equipped with RS-232 ports and must use either an external USB-to-RS-232 converter or an internal expansion card with one or more serial ports to connect to RS-232 peripherals. Nevertheless, RS-232 devices are still used, especially in industrial machines, networking equipment and scientific instruments.

Centronics Data Computer Corporation
Centronics Data Computer Corporation was an American manufacturer of computer printers, now remembered primarily for the [parallel interface] that bears its name.

Centronics began as a division of [Wang Laboratories]. Founded and initially operated by Robert Howard (president) and Samuel Lang (vice president and owner of the well known K & L Color Photo Service Lab in New York City), the group produced remote terminals and systems for the casino industry. Printers were developed to print receipts and transaction reports. Wang spun off the business in 1971 and Centronics was formed as a corporation in Hudson, New Hampshire with Howard as president and chairman.

The Centronics Model 101 was introduced at the 1970 National Computer Conference. The print head used an innovative seven-wire solenoid impact system. Based on this design, Centronics later made the claim to have developed the first dot matrix impact printer.

Howard developed a personal relationship with his neighbour, Max Hugel, the founder and president of [Brother International], the United States arm of Brother Industries, Ltd., a manufacturer of sewing machines and typewriters. A business relationship developed when Centronics needed reliable manufacturing of the printer mechanisms a relationship that would help propel Brother into the printer industry. Hugel would later become executive vice president of Centronics. Print heads and electronics were built in Centronics plants in New Hampshire and Ireland, mechanisms were built in Japan by Brother and the printers were assembled in New Hampshire.

In the 1970s, Centronics formed a relationship with Canon to develop non-impact printers. No products were ever produced, but Canon continued to work on laser printers, eventually developing a highly successful series of engines.

In 1977, Centronics sued competitor Mannesmann AG in a patent dispute regarding the return spring used in the print actuator.

In 1975, Centronics formed an [OEM] agreement with [Tandy] and produced DMP and LP series printers for several years. The 6000 series band printers were introduced in 1978. By 1979 company revenues were over $100 million.

In 1980, the Mini-Printer Model 770 was introduced a small, low-cost desktop serial matrix printer. This was the first printer built completely in-house, and there were problems. Flaws in the microprocessor led to a recall and a stoppage of manufacturing for a year. During this period, Epson, Brother and others began to gain market share and Centronics never recovered. 1980 also saw the introduction of the E Series 900 and 1200 LPM band printers.
===

Dot Matrix Printing
Dot matrix printing or impact matrix printing is a type of computer printing which uses a print head that moves back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.

In the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix impact printers were generally considered the best combination of expense and versatility, and until the 1990s they were by far the most common form of printer used with personal and home computers.

The [Epson] MX-80, introduced in 1979, was the groundbreaking model that sparked the initial popularity of impact printers in the personal computer market. The MX-80 combined affordability with good quality text output (for its time). Early impact printers (including the MX) were notoriously loud during operation, a result of the hammer like mechanism in the print head. The MX-80 even inspired the name of a noise rock band. The MX-80's low dot density (60 dpi horizontal, 72 dpi vertical) produced printouts of a distinctive "computerised" quality. When compared to the crisp typewriter quality of a daisy-wheel printer, the dot-matrix printer's legibility appeared especially bad. In office applications, output quality was a serious issue, as the dot-matrix text's readability would rapidly degrade with each photocopy generation. [IBM] sold the MX-80 as IBM 5125.
===

Parallel Port
A parallel port is a type of interface found on computers (personal and otherwise) for connecting peripherals. In computing, a parallel port is a parallel communication physical interface. It is also known as a printer port or Centronics port. It was an industry de facto standard for many years, and was finally standardised as IEEE 1284 in the late 1990s, which defined the Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) and Extended Capability Port (ECP) bi-directional versions. Today, the parallel port interface is seeing decreasing use because of the rise of Universal Serial Bus ([USB]) devices, along with network printing using [Ethernet].

The parallel port interface was originally known as the Parallel Printer Adapter on [IBM PC compatible] computers. It was primarily designed to operate a line printer that used [IBM]'s [8-bit] extended [ASCII] character set to print text, but could also be used to adapt other peripherals. Graphical printers, along with a host of other devices, have been designed to communicate with the system.

The term "Centronics port" now commonly refers to an IEEE-1284 Type B or 36-pin micro ribbon interface. The first parallel interface for printers was introduced with the [Centronics] Model 101 printer in 1970. The interface was developed by Dr. An Wang, Robert Howard and Prentice Robinson at Centronics. [Wang] had a surplus stock of 20,000 Amphenol 36-pin micro ribbon connectors that were originally used for one of their early calculators, which they used to create the Centronics interface on their computers. The connector has become so closely associated with Centronics that it is now popularly known as the “Centronics connector”.

The Centronics parallel interface quickly became an industry de facto standard; manufacturers of the time tended to use various connectors on the system side, so a variety of cables were required. For example, early [VAX] systems used a DC-37 connector, NCR used the 36-pin micro ribbon connector, [Texas Instruments] used a 25-pin card edge connector and [Data General] used a 50-pin micro ribbon connector.

When IBM implemented the parallel interface on the IBM PC, they used the DB-25F connector at the PC-end of the interface, creating the now familiar parallel cable with a DB25M at one end and a 36 pin micro ribbon connector at the other. [HP] adopted Centronics parallel on their printer models and introduced a bidirectional version known as Bitronics on the LaserJet 4 in 1992. The Bitronics and Centronics interfaces were superseded by the IEEE 1284 standard in 1994.

Centronics parallel is generally compliant with IEEE 1284 compatibility mode. The original Centronics implementation called for the busy lead to toggle with each received line of data (busy by line), whereas IEEE 1284 calls for busy to toggle with each received character (busy by character). Some host systems or print servers may use a strobe signal with a relatively low voltage output or a fast toggle. Any of these issues might cause no or intermittent printing, missing or repeated characters or garbage printing. Some printer models may have a switch or setting to set busy by character; others may require a handshake adapter.

Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley is a nickname for the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area in California, United States. It is home to many of the world's largest high-tech corporations, as well as thousands of tech startup companies. The region occupies roughly the same area as the Santa Clara Valley where it is centered, including San Jose and surrounding cities and towns. The term originally referred to the large number of silicon chip innovators and manufacturers in the region, but eventually came to refer to all high tech businesses in the area, and is now generally used as a metonym for the American high-technology economic sector.

Silicon Valley is a leading hub and startup ecosystem for high-tech innovation and development, accounting for one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States. Geographically, Silicon Valley is generally thought to encompass all of the Santa Clara Valley, San Francisco, the San Francisco Peninsula, and southern portions of the East Bay.

USB - Universal Serial Bus
USB, short for Universal Serial Bus, is an industry standard developed in the mid 1990s that defines the cables, connectors and communications protocols used in a bus for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and electronic devices.

USB was designed to standardise the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices.

USB 1.x
Released in January 1996, USB 1.0 specified data rates of 1.5 Mbit/s (Low Bandwidth or Low Speed) and 12 Mbit/s (Full Bandwidth or Full Speed). It did not allow for extension cables or pass-through monitors, due to timing and power limitations. Few USB devices made it to the market until USB 1.1 was released in August 1998, fixing problems identified in 1.0, mostly related to using hubs. USB 1.1 was the earliest revision that was widely adopted.

USB 2.0
USB 2.0 was released in April 2000, adding a higher maximum signalling rate of 480 Mbit/s called High Speed, in addition to the USB 1.x Full Speed signalling rate of 12 Mbit/s. Due to bus access constraints, the effective throughput of the High Speed signalling rate is limited to 35 MB/s or 280 Mbit/s.

Further modifications to the USB specification have been made via Engineering Change Notices (ECN). The most important of these ECNs are included into the USB 2.0 specification package available from USB.org.

- Mini-A and Mini-B Connector ECN: Released in October 2000.
	- Specifications for mini-A and B plug and receptacle. Also receptacle that accepts both plugs for On-The-Go. These should not be confused with micro-B plug and receptacle.
- Pull-up/Pull-down Resistors ECN: Released in May 2002
	- Interface Associations ECN: Released in May 2003.
	- New standard descriptor was added that allows associating multiple interfaces with a single device function.
- Rounded Chamfer ECN: Released in October 2003.
	- A recommended, backward compatible change to mini-B plugs that results in longer lasting connectors.
- Unicode ECN: Released in February 2005.
	- This ECN specifies that strings are encoded using UTF-16LE. USB 2.0 specified Unicode, but did not specify the encoding.
- Inter-Chip USB Supplement: Released in March 2006
- On-The-Go Supplement 1.3: Released in December 2006.
	- USB On-The-Go makes it possible for two USB devices to communicate with each other without requiring a separate USB host. In practice, one of the USB devices acts as a host for the other device.
- Battery Charging Specification 1.1: Released in March 2007 and updated on 15 April 2009.
	- Adds support for dedicated chargers (power supplies with USB connectors), host chargers (USB hosts that can act as chargers) and the No Dead Battery provision, which allows devices to temporarily draw 100 mA current after they have been attached. If a USB device is connected to dedicated charger, maximum current drawn by the device may be as high as 1.8 A. (Note that this document is not distributed with USB 2.0 specification package, only USB 3.0 and USB On-The-Go.)
- Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification 1.01: Released in April 2007.
- Link Power Management Addendum ECN: Released in July 2007.
	- This adds "sleep", a new power state between enabled and suspended states. Device in this state is not required to reduce its power consumption. However, switching between enabled and sleep states is much faster than switching between enabled and suspended states, which allows devices to sleep while idle.
- Battery Charging Specification 1.2 Released in December 2010.
	- Several changes and increasing limits including allowing 1.5 A on charging ports for unconfigured devices, allowing High Speed communication while having a current up to 1.5 A and allowing a maximum current of 5 A.

USB 3.0
USB 3.0 standard was released in November 2008, defining a new SuperSpeed mode. A USB 3.0 port, usually coloured blue, is backward compatible with USB 2.0 devices and cables.

The USB 3.0 Promoter Group announced on 17 November 2008 that the specification of version 3.0 had been completed and had made the transition to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), the managing body of USB specifications. This move effectively opened the specification to hardware developers for implementation in products.

The new SuperSpeed bus provides a fourth transfer mode with a data signalling rate of 5.0 Gbit/s, in addition to the modes supported by earlier versions. The payload throughput is 4 Gbit/s (due to the overhead induced by used 8b/10b encoding), and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve around 3.2 Gbit/s (0.4 GB/s or 400 MB/s), which should increase with future hardware advances. Communication is full-duplex in SuperSpeed transfer mode; in the modes supported previously, by 1.x and 2.0, communication is half-duplex, with direction controlled by the host.

As with previous USB versions, USB 3.0 ports come in low-power and high-power variants, providing 150 mA and 900 mA respectively, while simultaneously transmitting data at SuperSpeed rates. Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2 – December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5 A but does not allow concurrent data transmission. The Battery Charging Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5 A of current but limits the maximum current drawn to 1.5 A.

USB 3.1
A January 2013 press release from the USB group revealed plans to update USB 3.0 to 10 Gbit/s. The group ended up creating a new USB version, USB 3.1, which was released on 31 July 2013, introducing a faster transfer mode called "SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbit/s", putting it on par with a single first-generation Thunderbolt channel. The new mode's logo features a "Superspeed+" caption (stylised as SUPERSPEED+). The USB 3.1 standard increases the data signalling rate to 10 Gbit/s in the USB 3.1 Gen2 mode, double that of USB 3.0 (referred to as USB 3.1 Gen1) and reduces line encoding overhead to just 3% by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b. The first USB 3.1 implementation demonstrated transfer speeds of 7.2 Gbit/s.

The USB 3.1 standard is backward compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0.

USB Type-C
Developed at roughly the same time as the USB 3.1 specification, but distinct from it, the USB Type-C Specification 1.0 defines a new small reversible plug connector for USB devices. The Type-C plug connects to both hosts and devices, replacing various Type-B and Type-A connectors and cables with a standard meant to be future proof, similar to [Apple] Lightning and Thunderbolt. The 24-pin double-sided connector provides four power / ground pairs, two differential pairs for USB 2.0 data bus (though only one pair is implemented in a Type-C cable), four pairs for high-speed data bus, two "sideband use" pins, and two configuration pins for cable orientation detection, dedicated biphase mark code (BMC) configuration data channel, and VCONN +5 V power for active cables. Type-A and Type-B adaptors and cables will be required for older devices in order to plug into Type-C hosts; adaptors and cables with a Type-C receptacle are not allowed.

Full-featured USB Type-C cables are active, electronically marked cables that contain a chip with an ID function based on the configuration data channel and vendor defined messages (VDMs) from the USB Power Delivery 2.0 specification. USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5 A and 3.0 A over the 5 V power bus in addition to baseline 900 mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line, or they can support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.

Alternate Mode dedicates some of the physical wires in the Type-C cable for direct device-to-host transmission of alternate data protocols. The four high-speed lanes, two sideband pins, and—​for dock, detachable device and permanent cable applications only two USB 2.0 pins and one configuration pin can be used for Alternate Mode transmission. The modes are configured using VDMs through the configuration channel.

Sound Blaster
The Sound Blaster family of sound cards was the de facto standard for consumer audio on the [IBM PC compatible] system platform, until the widespread transition to [Microsoft Windows 95], which standardised the programming interface at application level (eliminating the importance of backward compatibility with Sound Blaster), and the evolution in PC design led to onboard motherboard-audio, which commoditised PC audio functionality.

The creator of Sound Blaster is the Singapore based firm [Creative Technology Limited], also known by the name of its United States subsidiary, Creative Labs.

Sound Blaster 16
The Sound Blaster 16, announced in June 1992, introduced:

- 16-bit CD-quality digital audio sampling;
- An MPU-401 compatible UART;
- A socket for the optional Advanced Signal Processor or Creative Signal Processor chip (ASP or later CSP); and
- A connector for the Wave Blaster, a 'Wavetable' daughterboard (sample-based synthesis).

The Sound Blaster 16 retained the Yamaha OPL-3 for FM synthesis and a backward compatible programming interface, so most software titles written for the older Sound Blasters and Sound Blaster Pros would run without modification.

Eventually this design proved so popular that Creative made a [PCI] version of this card. Moving the card off the [ISA] bus, which was already approaching obsolescence, meant that no line for host controlled ISA DMA was available, as the PCI slot offers no such line. Instead, the card used PCI bus mastering to transfer data from the main memory to the D/A converters. Since existing [DOS] programs expected to be able to initiate host controlled ISA DMA for producing sound, backward compatibility with the older Sound Blaster cards for DOS programs required a software driver work around; since this work around necessarily depended on the virtual [8086] mode of the PC's CPU in order to catch and reroute accesses from the ISA DMA controller to the card itself, it failed for a number of DOS games that either were not fully compatible with this CPU mode or needed so much free conventional memory that they could not be loaded with the driver occupying part of this memory. In [Microsoft Windows], there was no problem, as Creative's Windows driver software could handle both ISA and PCI cards correctly.

Sound Blaster AWE32
Released in March 1994, the Sound Blaster AWE32 (Advanced Wave Effects) introduced an all new MIDI synthesizer section based on the EMU8000. The AWE32 consisted of two distinct audio sections; the Creative digital audio section (audio codec, optional CSP/ASP chip socket, Yamaha OPL3), and the E-mu MIDI synthesizer section. The synthesizer section consisted of the EMU8000 sampler and effects processor, an EMU8011 1 MB sample ROM, and 512 KB of sample RAM (expandable to 28 MB). To fit the new hardware, the AWE32 was a full-length ISA card, measuring 14 in (360 mm).

Sound Blaster 32
A derivative of the AWE32 design, the Sound Blaster 32 (SB32) was a value-oriented offering from Creative. Announced on 6 June 1995, the SB32 became the new entry-level card in the AWE32 product-line (previously held by the AWE32 Value). The SB32 retained the AWE32's EMU8000/EMU8011 MIDI-synthesis engine and built-in instrument ROM, but dropped the onboard RAM, the Wave Blaster header, and the CSP port. The SB32 used the Vibra chip to reduce component count, which meant bass/treble/gain control was limited compared to the AWE32. The loss of onboard RAM is offset by the inclusion of 30-pin SIMM RAM sockets, which allow up to 8 MB RAM to be installed and used by the EMU engine.

Sound Blaster AWE64
The AWE32's successor, the Sound Blaster AWE64 (November 1996), was significantly smaller, being a "half-length ISA card". It offered similar features to the AWE32, but also had a few notable improvements, including support for greater polyphony, although this was a product of 32 extra software emulated channels. The 30-pin SIMM slots from AWE32/SB32 were replaced with a proprietary memory format which could be (expensively) purchased from Creative.

The main improvements were better compatibility with older SB models, and an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The AWE64 came in three versions: A Value version (with 512KB of RAM), a Standard version (with 1 MB of RAM), and a Gold version (with 4 MB of RAM and a separate S/PDIF output).

Industry Standard Architecture (ISA)
Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is a retronym term for the [16-bit] internal bus of [IBM PC/AT] and similar computers based on the [Intel 80286] and its immediate successors during the 1980s. The bus was (largely) backward compatible with the [8-bit] bus of the [8088] based [IBM PC], including the [IBM PC/XT] as well as [IBM PC compatibles].

Originally referred to as the PC/AT-bus it was also termed I/O Channel by [IBM]. The ISA concept was coined by competing PC-clone manufacturers in the late 1980s or early 1990s as a reaction to IBM attempts to replace the AT-bus with its new and incompatible Micro Channel architecture.

The 16-bit ISA bus was used also with 32-bit processors for several years. An attempt to extend it to 32 bits, called Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), was not very successful, however. Later buses such as [VESA Local Bus] and [PCI] were used instead, often along with ISA slots on the same mainboard. A derivative of the AT bus structure is still used in the PCMCIA standard, Compact Flash, the PC/104 bus, and internally within Super I/O chips.

Conventional PCI
Conventional PCI, often shortened to PCI, is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer. PCI is the initialism for Peripheral Component Interconnect and is part of the PCI Local Bus standard. The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardised format that is independent of any particular processor's native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.

Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in [IBM PC compatibles], where it displaced the combination of several slow [ISA] slots and one fast [VESA Local Bus] slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as [USB] or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became AGP, itself a superset of conventional PCI, before giving way to PCI Express.

The first version of conventional PCI found in consumer desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33 MHz bus clock and 5 V signalling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one locating notch in the card. Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3 V slots, physically distinguished by a flipped physical connector to preventing accidental insertion of 5 V cards. Universal cards, which can operate on either voltage, have two notches. Version 2.1 of the PCI standard introduced optional 66 MHz operation. A server-oriented variant of conventional PCI, called PCI-X (PCI Extended) operated at frequencies up to 133 MHz for PCI-X 1.0 and up to 533 MHz for PCI-X 2.0. An internal connector for laptop cards, called Mini PCI, was introduced in version 2.2 of the PCI specification. The PCI bus was also adopted for an external laptop connector standard—the CardBus. The first PCI specification was developed by Intel, but subsequent development of the standard became the responsibility of the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG).

Conventional PCI and PCI-X are sometimes called Parallel PCI in order to distinguish them technologically from their more recent successor PCI Express, which adopted a serial, lane-based architecture. Conventional PCI's heyday in the desktop computer market was approximately the decade 1995 - 2005. PCI and PCI-X have become obsolete for most purposes; however, they are still common on modern desktops for the purposes of backwards compatibility and the low relative cost to produce. Many kinds of devices previously available on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and PCI Express versions.

VESA Local Bus 
The VESA Local Bus (usually abbreviated to VL-Bus or VLB) was mostly used in personal computers. VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) Local Bus worked alongside the [ISA] bus; it acted as a high-speed conduit for memory-mapped I/O and DMA, while the ISA bus handled interrupts and port-mapped I/O.

Creative Technology
Creative Technology Ltd is a Singapore based global company headquartered in Jurong East, Singapore. The principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries consist of the design, manufacture and distribution of digitised sound and video boards, computers and related multimedia, and personal digital entertainment products.

It also partners with mainboard manufacturers and laptop brands to embed its [Sound Blaster] technology on their products.
===

DOSBox
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates an [IBM PC compatible] computer running a [DOS] operating system. Many IBM PC compatible graphics and sound cards are also emulated. This means that original DOS programs (including PC games) are provided an environment in which they can run correctly, even though the modern computers have dropped support for that old environment. DOSBox is free software written primarily in [C++] and distributed under the [GNU General Public License]. DOSBox has been downloaded over 25 million times since its release on SourceForge in 2002.

DOSBox can run old DOS software on modern computers which would not work otherwise, because of incompatibilities between the older software and modern hardware and operating systems.

A number of usability enhancements have been added to DOSBox beyond emulating DOS. The added features include virtual hard drives, peer-to-peer networking, screen capture and screencasting from the emulated screen.

The original DOSBox has not been updated in a long time. Active development is happening on forks of DOSBox. Forks such as SVN Daum and DOSBox-X provide additional features, which include support for save states and long filenames.

A number of vintage DOS games have been re-released by video game developers to run on modern computers by encapsulating them inside DOSBox.

Character Encoding
In computing, a character encoding is used to represent a repertoire of characters by some kind of an encoding system. Depending on the abstraction level and context, corresponding code points and the resulting code space may be regarded as bit patterns, octets, natural numbers, electrical pulses, etc. A character encoding is used in computation, data storage, and transmission of textual data. Terms such as character set, character map, codeset or code page are sometimes used as near synonyms; however, these terms have related but distinct meanings described in the article.

Early character codes associated with the optical or electrical telegraph could only represent a subset of the characters used in written languages, sometimes restricted to upper case letters, numerals and some punctuation only. The low cost of digital representation of data in modern computer systems allows more elaborate character codes (such as [Unicode]) which represent more of the characters used in many written languages. Character encoding using internationally accepted standards permits worldwide interchange of text in electronic form.

ISO/IEC 8859-1
ISO/IEC 8859-1 is a [8-bit] single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of [ASCII] based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1987. It is generally intended for Western European languages. It is the basis for most popular 8-bit character sets, including [Windows-1252] and the first block of characters in [Unicode].

ISO-8859-1 is the IANA preferred name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. The following other aliases are registered for ISO-8859-1: iso-ir-100, csISOLatin1, latin1, l1, IBM819, CP819.

The Windows-1252 codepage coincides with ISO-8859-1 for all codes except the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F), where the little used C1 controls are replaced with additional characters including all the missing characters provided by ISO-8859-15. Code page 28591 a.k.a. Windows-28591 is the actual ISO-8859-1 codepage.
===

UTF-8
UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters, or code points, in [Unicode].

The encoding is variable length and uses [8-bit] code units. It was designed for backward compatibility with [ASCII], and to avoid the complications of endianness and byte order marks in the alternative [UTF-16] and [UTF-32] encodings. The name is derived from: Universal Coded Character Set + Transformation Format—8-bit.

UTF-8 is the dominant character encoding for the [World Wide Web], accounting for 84.3% of all Web pages in July 2015. The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) recommends that all e-mail programs be able to display and create mail using UTF-8, and the [W3C] recommends UTF-8 as the default encoding in [XML] and [HTML].

UTF-8 encodes each of the 1,112,064 valid code points in the Unicode code space (1,114,112 code points minus 2,048 surrogate code points) using one to four 8-bit bytes (a group of 8 bits is known as an octet in the Unicode Standard). Code points with lower numerical values (i.e., earlier code positions in the Unicode character set, which tend to occur more frequently) are encoded using fewer bytes. The first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII, making valid ASCII text valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well. And ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non-ASCII code points into UTF-8, making UTF-8 safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special way, e.g. as end of string.
===

UTF-16
UTF-16 (16-bit [Unicode] Transformation Format) is a character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 possible characters in Unicode. The encoding is variable-length, as code points are encoded with one or two [16-bit] code units. (also see Comparison of Unicode encodings for a comparison of [UTF-8], UTF-16 & [UTF-32])

UTF-16 developed from an earlier fixed-width 16-bit encoding known as UCS-2 (for 2-byte Universal Character Set) once it became clear that a fixed-width 2-byte encoding could not encode enough characters to be truly universal.
===

UTF-32
UTF-32 (or UCS-4) stands for [Unicode] Transformation Format [32-bits]. It is a protocol to encode Unicode characters that uses exactly 32-bits per Unicode code point. This makes UTF-32 a fixed-length encoding, in contrast to all other Unicode transformation formats which are variable-length encodings. The UTF-32 form of a character is a direct representation of its codepoint.

The main advantage of UTF-32, versus variable-length encodings, is that the Unicode code points are directly indexable. Examining the n'th code point is a constant time operation. In contrast, a variable-length code requires sequential access to find the n'th code point. This makes UTF-32 a simple replacement in code that uses integers to index characters out of strings, as was commonly done for [ASCII].

The main disadvantage of UTF-32 is that it is space inefficient, using four bytes per character. Non-BMP characters are so rare in most texts, they may as well be considered non-existent for sizing issues, making UTF-32 up to twice the size of UTF-16 and up to four times the size of UTF-8.
===

Windows-1252
Windows-1252 or CP-1252 is a character encoding of the Latin alphabet, used by default in the legacy components of [Microsoft Windows] in English and some other Western languages. It is one version within the group of [Windows code pages].

This character encoding is a superset of [ISO 8859-1], but differs from the IANA's ISO-8859-1 by using displayable characters rather than control characters in the 80 to 9F (hex) range. Notable additional characters are curly quotation marks, the Euro sign, and all the printable characters that are in ISO 8859-15. It is known to Windows by the code page number 1252, and by the IANA-approved name "windows‑1252".

It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the charset label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by "smart quotes" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the [MIME] charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling. This is now standard behaviour in the [HTML 5] specification, which requires that documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 encoding.

Historically, the phrase "ANSI Code Page" (ACP) is used in [Windows] to refer to various code pages considered as native. The intention was that most of these would be ANSI standards such as ISO-8859-1. Even though Windows-1252 was the first and by far most popular code page named so in Microsoft Windows parlance, the code page has never been an ANSI standard. Microsoft explains, "The term ANSI as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference, but is nowadays a misnomer that continues to persist in the Windows community."

Windows Code Pages
Windows code pages are sets of characters or code pages (known as character encodings in other operating systems) used in [Microsoft Windows] from the 1980s and 1990s. Windows code pages were gradually superseded when Unicode was implemented in Windows, although they are still supported both within Windows and other platforms.

There are two groups of code pages in Windows systems: OEM and ANSI code pages. Code pages in both of these groups are extended [ASCII] code pages.

ANSI code page
ANSI code pages (officially called "Windows code pages" after [Microsoft] accepted the former term being a misnomer) are used for native non-Unicode (say, byte oriented) applications using a graphical user interface on Windows systems. ANSI Windows code pages, and especially the code page 1252, were called that way since they were purportedly based on drafts submitted or intended for ANSI. However, ANSI and ISO have not standardised any of these code pages. Instead they are either supersets of the standard sets such as those of ISO 8859 and the various national standards (like Windows-1252 vs. ISO-8859-1), major modifications of these (making them incompatible to various degrees, like Windows-1250 vs. ISO-8859-2) or having no parallel encoding (like Windows-1257 vs. ISO-8859-4; ISO-8859-13 was introduced much later). About twelve of the typography and business characters from CP1252 at code points 0x80–0x9F (in ISO 8859 occupied by C1 control codes, which are useless in Windows) are present in many other ANSI / Windows code pages at the same codes. These code pages are labelled by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ([IANA]) as "Windows-number".

OEM code page
The OEM code pages (original equipment manufacturer) are used by Win32 console applications, and by virtual DOS, and can be considered a holdover from [DOS] and the original [IBM PC] architecture. A separate suite of code pages was implemented not only due to compatibility, but also because the fonts of [VGA] (and descendant) hardware suggest encoding of line drawing characters to be compatible with code page 437. Most OEM code pages share many code points, particularly for non-letter characters, with the second (non-ASCII) half of CP437.

A typical OEM code page, in its second half, does not resemble any ANSI / Windows code page even roughly. Nevertheless, two single-byte, fixed-width code pages (874 for Thai and 1258 for Vietnamese) and four multibyte CJK code pages (932, 936, 949, 950) are used as both OEM and ANSI code pages. Code page 1258 uses combining diacritics, as Vietnamese requires more than 128 letter-diacritic combinations. This is in contrast to VISCII, which replaces some of the C0 (i.e. ASCII) control codes.

Unicode
Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Character Set standard and published as The Unicode Standard, the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 120,000 characters covering 129 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts).[1] As of June 2015, the most recent version is Unicode 8.0. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium.

Unicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the internationalization and localization of computer software. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including modern operating systems, XML, the Java programming language, and the Microsoft .NET Framework.

Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and the now-obsolete UCS-2. UTF-8 uses one byte for any ASCII character, all of which have the same code values in both UTF-8 and ASCII encoding, and up to four bytes for other characters. UCS-2 uses a 16-bit code unit (two 8-bit bytes) for each character but cannot encode every character in the current Unicode standard. UTF-16 extends UCS-2, using one 16-bit unit for the characters that were representable in UCS-2 and two 16-bit units (4 × 8 bit) to handle each of the additional characters.
===

Universal Coded Character Set (UCS)
The Universal Coded Character Set (UCS), defined by the International Standard ISO/IEC 10646, Information technology — Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) (plus amendments to that standard), is a standard set of characters upon which many character encodings are based. The UCS contains nearly one hundred thousand abstract characters, each identified by an unambiguous name and an integer number called its code point.

Characters (letters, numbers, symbols, ideograms, logograms, etc.) from the many languages, scripts, and traditions of the world are represented in the UCS with unique code points. The inclusiveness of the UCS is continually improving as characters from previously unrepresented writing systems are added.

Since 1991, the Unicode Consortium has worked with ISO to develop The Unicode Standard ("Unicode") and ISO/IEC 10646 in tandem. The repertoire, character names, and code points of Version 2.0 of Unicode exactly match those of ISO/IEC 10646-1 with its first seven published amendments. After the publication of [Unicode] 3.0 in February 2000, corresponding new and updated characters entered the UCS via ISO/IEC 10646-1. In 2003, parts 1 and 2 of ISO/IEC 10646 were combined into a single part, which has since had a number of amendments adding characters to the standard in approximate synchrony with the Unicode standard.

The UCS has over 1.1 million code points available for use, but only the first 65,536 (the Basic Multilingual Plane, or BMP) had entered into common use before 2000. This situation began changing when the People's Republic of China (PRC) ruled in 2000 that all software sold in its jurisdiction would have to support GB 18030. This required software intended for sale in the PRC to move beyond the BMP.

The system deliberately leaves many code points not assigned to characters, even in the BMP. It does this to allow for future expansion or to minimize conflicts with other encoding forms.

Punched Card
A punched card, punch card, IBM card, or Hollerith card is a piece of stiff paper that contained either commands for controlling automated machinery or data for data processing applications. Both commands and data were represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions.

Now obsolete as a recording medium, punched cards were widely used throughout the 20th century for controlling textile looms and in the late 19th and early 20th century for controlling fairground organs and related instruments. Punched cards were used through most of the 20th century in what became known as the data processing industry; the use of unit record machines, organised into data processing systems, for data input, processing, and storage. Early digital computers used punched cards, often prepared using keypunch machines, as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.
==

Punched Tape
Punched tape or perforated paper tape is a form of data storage, consisting of a long strip of paper in which holes are punched to store data. Now effectively obsolete, it was widely used during much of the twentieth century for teleprinter communication, for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s, and later as a storage medium for minicomputers and [CNC] machine tools.

The earliest forms of punched tape come from weaving looms and embroidery, where cards with simple instructions about a machine's intended movements were first fed individually as instructions, then controlled by instruction cards, and later were fed as a string of connected cards.

This led to the concept of communicating data not as a stream of individual cards, but one "continuous card", or a tape. Many professional embroidery operations still refer to those individuals who create the designs and machine patterns as "punchers", even though punched cards and paper tape were eventually phased out, after many years of use, in the 1990s.

Tape Formats
Data were represented by the presence or absence of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data. Later tapes had 6, 7 and 8 rows. An early electro-mechanical calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I, used paper tape with 24 rows. A row of narrower holes that were always punched served to feed the tape, originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a sprocket wheel. Later optical readers used the sprocket holes to generate timing pulses.

Text was encoded in several ways. The earliest standard character encoding was Baudot, which dates back to the nineteenth century and had 5 holes. The Baudot code was never used in teleprinters. Instead, modifications such as the Murray code (which added carriage return and line feed), Western Union code, International Telegraphic Alphabet #2 (ITA 2), and American Teletypewriter code (USTTY), were used. Other standards, such as Teletypesetter (TTS), Fieldata and Flexowriter, had 6 holes. In the early 1960s, the American Standards Association led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as [ASCII]. This 7-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including AT&amp;T (Teletype). Others, such as Telex, stayed with the earlier codes.

Dimensions
Tape for punching was 0.00394 inches (0.1 mm) thick. The two most common widths were 11/16 inch (17.46 mm) for five bit codes, and 1 inch (25.4 mm) for tapes with six or more bits. Hole spacing was 0.1 inch (2.54 mm) in both directions. Data holes were 0.072 inches (1.83 mm) in diameter; feed holes were 0.046 inches (1.17 mm). Paper tape rolls in both widths are still commercially available as of 2012.

Chad
Most tape-punching equipment used solid punches to create holes in the tape. This process inevitably created "chad", or small circular pieces of paper. Managing the disposal of chad was an annoying and complex problem, as the tiny paper pieces had a tendency to escape and interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the teleprinter equipment.

Disc Filing System (DFS)
The Disc Filing System (DFS) is a computer file system developed by [Acorn Computers], initially as an add-on to the Eurocard-based Acorn System 2.

In 1981, the Education Departments of Western Australia and South Australia announced joint tenders calling for the supply of personal computers to their schools. Acorn's Australian computer distributor, Barson Computers, convinced Joint Managing Directors Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry to allow the soon to be released [Acorn BBC Microcomputer] to be offered with disk storage as part of the bundle. They agreed on condition that Barson adapted the Acorn DFS from the System 2 without assistance from Acorn as they had no resources available. This required some minor hardware and software changes to make the DFS compatible with the BBC Micro.

Barson won the tenders for both states, with the DFS fitted, a year ahead of the UK. It was this early initiative that resulted in the BBC Micro being more heavily focused on the education market in Australia, with very little penetration of the home computer market until the arrival of the [Acorn Electron].

The DFS shipped as a [ROM] and Disk Controller Chip fitted to the BBC Micro's motherboard. The filing system was of extremely limited functionality and storage capability, using a flat directory structure. Each filename can be up to seven letters long, plus one letter for the directory in which the file is stored.

The DFS is remarkable in that unlike most filing systems, there was no single vendor or implementation. The original DFS was written by Acorn, who continued to maintain their own codebase, but various disc drive vendors wrote their own implementations. Companies who wrote their own DFS implementation included Cumana, Opus and [Watford Electronics]. The Watford Electronics implementation is notable for supporting 62 files per disc instead of the usual 31, using a non-standard disc format. Other features in third-party implementations included being able to review free space, and built-in FORMAT and VERIFY commands, which were shipped on a utility disc with the original Acorn DFS.

Acorn followed up their original DFS series with the Acorn 1770 DFS, which used the same disc format as the earlier version but added a set of extra commands and supported the improved WD1770 floppy drive controller chip.
===

Advanced Disc Filing System (ADFS) 
The Advanced Disc Filing System (ADFS) is a computing file system particular to the [Acorn] computer range and RISC OS-based successors. Initially based on the rare Acorn Winchester Filing System, it was renamed to the Advanced Disc Filing System when support for floppy discs was added (utilising a WD1770 floppy disc controller) and on later 32-bit systems a variant of a PC-style floppy controller.

Acorn's original [Disc Filing System] was limited to 31 files per disk surface, 7 characters per file name and a single character for directory names, a format inherited from the earlier [Atom] and System 3–5 Eurocard computers. To overcome some of these restrictions Acorn developed ADFS. The most dramatic change was the introduction of a hierarchical directory structure. The filename length increased from 7 to 10 letters and the number of files in a directory expanded to 47. It retained some superficial attributes from DFS; the directory separator continued to be a dot and $ now indicated the hierarchical root of the filesystem. "^" (minus the quotes) was used to refer to the parent directory and "\" was the previously-visited directory.

The [BBC Master Compact] contained ADFS Version 2.0, which provided the addition of format, verify and backup commands in [ROM].

Floppy Disk
A floppy disk, also called a diskette, is a disk storage medium composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic carrier lined with fabric that removes dust particles. Floppy disks are read and written by a floppy disk drive (FDD).

Floppy disks, initially as 8-inch (200 mm) media and later in 5¼-inch (133 mm) and 3½-inch (90 mm) sizes, were a ubiquitous form of data storage and exchange from the mid 1970s well into the 2000s.

By 2010, computer motherboards were rarely manufactured with floppy drive support; 3½-inch floppy disks can be used with an external USB floppy disk drive, but USB drives for 5¼-inch, 8-inch and non-standard diskettes are rare or non-existent, and those formats must usually be handled by old equipment.

While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses, especially with legacy industrial computer equipment, they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater capacity, such as USB flash drives, portable external hard disk drives, optical discs, memory cards and computer networks.

8-inch Floppy Disk
The first floppy disk was 8 inches in diameter, was protected by a flexible plastic jacket and was a read-only device used by [IBM] as a way of loading microcode. Read / Write floppy disks and their drives became available in 1972 but it was IBM's 1973 introduction of the 3740 data entry system that began the establishment of floppy disks, called by IBM the "Diskette 1," as an industry standard for information interchange. Early microcomputers used for engineering, business, or word processing often used one or more 8-inch disk drives for removable storage; the [CP/M] operating system was developed for microcomputers with 8-inch drives.

The family of 8-inch disks and drives increased over time and later versions could store up to 1.2MB many microcomputer applications did not need that much capacity on one disk, so a smaller size disk with lower-cost media and drives was feasible. The 5¼-inch inch drive succeeded the 8-inch size in many applications, and developed to about the same storage capacity as the original 8-inch size, using higher-density media and recording techniques.

5¼-inch Floppy Disk
The head gap of an 80‑track high-density (1.2MB in the MFM format) 5¼‑inch drive (a.k.a. Mini diskette, Mini disk, or Minifloppy) is smaller than that of a 40‑track double-density (360KB) drive but can format, read and write 40‑track disks well provided the controller supports double stepping or has a switch to do such a process. A blank 40‑track disk formatted and written on an 80‑track drive can be taken to its native drive without problems, and a disk formatted on a 40‑track drive can be used on an 80‑track drive. Disks written on a 40‑track drive and then updated on an 80 track drive become unreadable on any 40‑track drives due to track width incompatibility.

Single sided disks were coated on both sides, despite the availability of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free on both sides of the media. Architectural differences among computer platforms negated this claim, however, with RadioShack TRS-80 Model I computers using one side and the Apple II machines the other. Double-sided disks could be used in drives for single-sided disks, one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.

3½-inch Floppy Disk
In the early 1980s, a number of manufacturers introduced smaller floppy drives and media in various formats. A consortium of 21 companies eventually settled on a 3½-inch floppy disk (actually 90 mm wide) a.k.a. Micro diskette, Micro disk, or Micro floppy, similar to a [Sony] design, but improved to support both single-sided and double-sided media, with formatted capacities generally of 360KB and 720KB respectively. Single-sided drives shipped in 1983, and double sided in 1984. What became the most common format, the double-sided, high-density (HD) 1.44MB disk drive, shipped in 1986.

The first [Macintosh] computers used single-sided 3½-inch inch floppy disks, but with 400KB formatted capacity. These were followed in 1986 by double-sided 800KB floppies. The higher capacity was achieved at the same recording density by varying the disk rotation speed with arm position so that the linear speed of the head was closer to constant. Later Macs could also read and write 1.44MB HD disks in [PC] format with fixed rotation speed.

All 3½-inch disks have a rectangular hole in one corner which, if obstructed, write-enabled the disk. The HD 1.44MB disks have a second, unobstructed hole in the opposite corner which identifies them as being of that capacity.

In [IBM-compatible PCs], the three densities of 3½-inch floppy disks are backwards-compatible: higher density drives can read, write and format lower density media. It is physically possible to format a disk at the wrong density, although the resulting disk will not work properly. Fresh disks manufactured as high density can theoretically be formatted at double density only if no information has been written on the disk in high density, or the disk has been thoroughly demagnetised with a bulk eraser, as the magnetic strength of a high density record is stronger and overrides lower density, remaining on the disk and causing problems.

Writing at different densities than disks were intended for, sometimes by altering or drilling holes, was possible but deprecated. The holes on the right side of a 3½‑inch disk can be altered as to make some disk drives and operating systems treat the disk as one of higher or lower density, for bidirectional compatibility or economical reasons. Some computers, such as the [PS/2] and [Acorn Archimedes], ignored these holes altogether.

It is possible to make a 3½-inch floppy disk drive be recognised by a system as a 5¼‑inch 360KB or 1200KB drive, and to read and write disks with the same number of tracks and sectors as those disks; this had some application in data exchange with obsolete [CP/M] systems.

Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk is a data storage device used for storing and retrieving digital information using one or more rigid ("hard") rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order rather than sequentially. An HDD retains its data even when powered off.

Introduced by [IBM] in 1956, HDDs became the dominant secondary storage device for general purpose computers by the early 1960s. Continuously improved, HDDs have maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers. More than 200 companies have produced HDD units, though most current units are manufactured by [Seagate], [Toshiba] and [Western Digital].

The primary characteristics of an HDD are its capacity and performance. Capacity is specified in unit prefixes corresponding to powers of 1000: a 1-terabyte (TB) drive has a capacity of 1,000 gigabytes (GB; where 1 gigabyte = 1 billion bytes). Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by the file system and the computer operating system, and possibly inbuilt redundancy for error correction and recovery. Performance is specified by the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder (average access time) plus the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head (average latency, which is a function of the physical rotational speed in revolutions per minute), and finally the speed at which the data is transmitted (data rate).

The two most common form factors for modern HDDs are 3.5-inch, for desktop computers, and 2.5-inch, primarily for laptops. HDDs are connected to systems by standard interface cables such as SATA (Serial ATA), USB or SAS (Serial attached SCSI) cables.

As of 2015, the primary competing technology for secondary storage is flash memory in the form of solid-state drives ([SSD]s), which have higher data transfer rates and significantly lower latency and access times, but HDDs remain the dominant medium for secondary storage due to advantages in price per unit of storage and recording capacity. However, SSDs are replacing HDDs where speed, power consumption and durability are more important considerations.
===

SCSI
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices. The SCSI standards define commands, protocols and electrical and optical interfaces. SCSI is most commonly used for hard disk drives and tape drives, but it can connect a wide range of other devices, including scanners and CD drives, although not all controllers can handle all devices. The SCSI standard defines command sets for specific peripheral device types; the presence of "unknown" as one of these types means that in theory it can be used as an interface to almost any device, but the standard is highly pragmatic and addressed toward commercial requirements.
===

Solid State Drive (SSD) 
A solid state drive (SSD) (also known as a solid state disk though it contains no actual disk, nor a drive motor to spin a disk) is a solid state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently. SSD technology primarily uses electronic interfaces compatible with traditional block input/output (I/O) hard disk drives, which permit simple replacements in common applications. Additionally, new I/O interfaces, like SATA Express, have been designed to address specific requirements of the SSD technology.

SSDs have no moving (mechanical) components. This distinguishes them from traditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as [hard disk drives] (HDDs) or [floppy disks], which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads. Compared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, have lower access time, and less latency. However, while the price of SSDs has continued to decline over time, consumer grade SSDs are still roughly six to seven times more expensive per unit of storage than consumer grade HDDs.

As of 2014, most SSDs use NAND based flash memory, which retains data without power. For applications requiring fast access, but not necessarily data persistence after power loss, SSDs may be constructed from random access memory (RAM). Such devices may employ separate power sources, such as batteries, to maintain data after power loss.

Hybrid drives or solid state hybrid drives (SSHDs) combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data.

Light Pen 
A light pen is a computer input device in the form of a light sensitive wand used in conjunction with a computer's [CRT] display.

It allows the user to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in a similar way to a touchscreen but with greater positional accuracy. A light pen can work with any CRT based display and other display technologies, but its ability to be used with LCDs was unclear (though Toshiba and Hitachi displayed a similar idea at the "Display 2006" show in Japan).

A light pen detects a change of brightness of nearby screen pixels when scanned by cathode ray tube electron beam and communicates the timing of this event to the computer. Since a CRT scans the entire screen one pixel at a time, the computer can keep track of the expected time of scanning various locations on screen by the beam and infer the pen's position from the latest timestamp.

The first light pen was created around 1955 as part of the Whirlwind project at [MIT].

During the 1960s light pens were common on graphics terminals such as the IBM 2250, and were also available for the IBM 3270 text-only terminal.

The light pen was used in the early 1980s. It was notable for its use in the Fairlight CMI, and the [BBC Micro]. [IBM PC compatible] [CGA], [HGC] and some [EGA] graphics cards featured a connector for a light pen as well. Even some consumer products were given light pens, such as the Thomson MO5 computer family as well as the [Atari 8-bit] and [Commodore 8-bit] home computers.

Because the user was required to hold his / her arm in front of the screen for long periods of time or to use a desk that tilts the monitor, the light pen fell out of use as a general purpose input device.
===

Trackball
A trackball is a pointing device consisting of a ball held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball about two axes—like an upside-down mouse with an exposed protruding ball. The user rolls the ball with the thumb, fingers, or the palm of the hand to move a pointer.

Compared with a mouse, a trackball has no limits on effective travel; at times, a mouse can reach an edge of its working area while the operator still wishes to move the screen pointer farther. With a trackball, the operator just continues rolling, whereas a mouse would have to be lifted and re-positioned. Some trackballs have notably low friction, as well as being made of dense material such as glass, so they can be spun to make them coast. The trackball's buttons may be situated to that of a mouse or to a unique style that suits the user.

Large trackballs are common on [CAD] workstations for easy precision. Before the advent of the touchpad, small trackballs were common on portable computers, where there may be no desk space on which to run a mouse. Some small thumbballs clip onto the side of the keyboard and have integral buttons with the same function as mouse buttons.

The trackball was invented as part of a post World War II era radar plotting system named Comprehensive Display System (CDS) by Ralph Benjamin when working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service. Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick. Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented a ball tracker system called the roller ball for this purpose in 1946. The device was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built and the device was kept as a military secret.

Graphics Tablet
A graphics tablet or digitiser is a computer input device that enables a user to hand draw images, animations and graphics, similar to the way a person draws images with a pencil and paper. These tablets may also be used to capture data or handwritten signatures. It can also be used to trace an image from a piece of paper which is taped or otherwise secured to the surface. Capturing data in this way, by tracing or entering the corners of linear poly-lines or shapes, is called digitising.

The device consists of a flat surface upon which the user may "draw" or trace an image using an attached stylus, a pen like drawing apparatus. The image is displayed on the computer monitor, although some graphics tablets also have a screen.

Some tablets are intended as a replacement for the mouse as the primary pointing and navigation device for desktop computers.

Digitisers were popularised in the mid 1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitiser) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitisers were used as the input device for many high-end CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems as well as bundled with PCs and PC-based CAD software like [AutoCAD].

Summagraphics also made an [OEM] version of its BitPad which was sold by [Apple Computer] as the Apple Graphics Tablet accessory to their [Apple II]. These tablets used a magnetostriction technology which used wires made of a special alloy stretched over a solid substrate to accurately locate the tip of a stylus or the center of a digitiser cursor on the surface of the tablet. This technology also allowed Proximity or "Z" axis measurement.

The first home computer graphics tablet was the KoalaPad. Though originally designed for the Apple II, the Koala eventually broadened its applicability to practically all home computers with graphics support, examples of which include the TRS-80 Color Computer, [Commodore 64], and [Atari 8-bit family]. Competing tablets were eventually produced; the tablets produced by Atari were generally considered to be of high quality.

In 1981, musician Todd Rundgren created the first color graphics tablet software for personal computers, which was licensed to Apple as the Utopia Graphics Tablet System.

In the 1980s, several vendors of graphics tablets began to include additional functions, such as handwriting recognition and on tablet menus.

Webcam
A webcam is a video camera that feeds or streams its image in real time to or through a computer to computer network. When "captured" by the computer, the video stream may be saved, viewed or sent on to other networks via systems such as the Internet, and email as an attachment. When sent to a remote location, the video stream may be saved, viewed or on sent there. Unlike an IP camera (which connects using [Ethernet] or [Wi-Fi]), a webcam is generally connected by a USB cable, or similar cable, or built into computer hardware, such as laptops.

The term 'webcam' (a clipped compound) may also be used in its original sense of a video camera connected to the Web continuously for an indefinite time, rather than for a particular session, generally supplying a view for anyone who visits its web page over the Internet. Some of them, for example, those used as online traffic cameras, are expensive, rugged professional video cameras.
===

Plotter
The plotter is a computer printer for printing vector graphics. In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer aided design ([CAD]), though they have generally been replaced with wide format conventional printers. A plotter gives a hard copy of the output. It draws pictures on a paper using a pen. Plotters are used to print designs of ships and machines, plans for buildings and so on.

Pen plotters print by moving a pen or other instrument across the surface of a piece of paper. This means that plotters are vector graphics devices, rather than raster graphics as with other printers. Pen plotters can draw complex line art, including text, but do so slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens. They are often incapable of efficiently creating a solid region of color, but can hatch an area by drawing a number of close, regular lines.

Plotters offered the fastest way to efficiently produce very large drawings or colour high-resolution vector-based artwork when computer memory was very expensive and processor power was very limited, and other types of printers had limited graphic output capabilities.

Pen plotters have essentially become obsolete, and have been replaced by large format inkjet printers and LED toner based printers. Such devices may still understand vector languages originally designed for plotter use, because in many uses, they offer a more efficient alternative to raster data.

Electrostatic Plotters
Electrostatic plotters used a dry toner transfer process similar to that in many photocopiers. They were faster than pen plotters and were available in large formats, suitable for reproducing engineering drawings. The quality of image was often not as good as contemporary pen plotters. Electrostatic plotters were made in both flat-bed and drum types.

Cutting Plotters
Cutting plotters use knives to cut into a piece of material (such as paper, mylar or vinyl) that is lying on the flat surface area of the plotter. It is achieved because the cutting plotter is connected to a computer, which is equipped with specialised cutting design or drawing computer software programs. Those computer software programs are responsible for sending the necessary cutting dimensions or designs in order to command the cutting knife to produce the correct project cutting needs.

In recent years the use of cutting plotters (generally called die-cut machines) has become popular with home enthusiasts of paper crafts such as card making and scrapbooking. Such tools allow desired card shapes to be cut out very precisely, and repeated perfectly identically.

CRT - Cathode Ray Tube
The Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns, and a fluorescent screen used to view images. It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets or others. CRTs have also been used as memory devices, in which case the visible light emitted from the fluorescent material (if any) is not intended to have significant meaning to a visual observer (though the visible pattern on the tube face may cryptically represent the stored data).

The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.

CRTs have largely been superseded by newer display technologies such as [LCD], [plasma display], and [OLED], which have lower manufacturing costs, power consumption, weight and bulk.

The vacuum level inside the tube is high vacuum on the order of 0.01 Pa to 133 nPa.

In television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary colour (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference. In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of diagnostic instrument.

OLED - Organic Light Emitting Diode
An Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) is a Light Emitting Diode ([LED]) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either passive-matrix (PMOLED) or active-matrix addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs (AMOLED) require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.

An OLED display works without a backlight; thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a Liquid Crystal Display ([LCD]). In low ambient light conditions (such as a dark room), an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, regardless of whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or an LED backlight.

Plasma Display
A plasma display panel (PDP) is a type of flat panel display common to large TV displays 30 inches (76 cm) or larger. They are called "plasma" displays because they use small cells containing electrically charged ionised gases, which are plasmas.

Plasma displays are bright (1,000 lux or higher for the module), have a wide color gamut, and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to 3.8 metres (150 in) diagonally. They had a very low-luminance "dark-room" black level compared with the lighter grey of the unilluminated parts of an LCD screen at least in the early history of the competing technologies (in the early history of plasma panels the blacks were blacker on plasmas and greyer on LCDs). LED backlit LCD televisions have been developed to reduce this distinction. The display panel itself is about 6 cm (2.4 in) thick, generally allowing the device's total thickness (including electronics) to be less than 10 cm (3.9 in). Power consumption varies greatly with picture content, with bright scenes drawing significantly more power than darker ones – this is also true for [CRTs] as well as modern LCDs where LED backlight brightness is adjusted dynamically. The plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least 1200 °C (2200 °F). Typical power consumption is 400 watts for a 127 cm (50 in) screen. 200 to 310 watts for a 127 cm (50 in) display when set to cinema mode. Most screens are set to "shop" mode by default, which draws at least twice the power (around 500 – 700 watts) of a "home" setting of less extreme brightness. Panasonic has greatly reduced power consumption ("1/3 of 2007 models"). Panasonic states that PDPs will consume only half the power of their previous series of plasma sets to achieve the same overall brightness for a given display size. The lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours of actual display time, or 27 years at 10 hours per day. This is the estimated time over which maximum picture brightness degrades to half the original value.

This causes glare from reflected objects in the viewing area. Companies such as Panasonic coat their newer plasma screens with an anti-glare filter material. Currently, plasma panels cannot be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than 82 centimetres (32 in). Although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced definition televisions (EDTV) this small, even fewer have made 32 inch plasma HDTVs. With the trend toward large-screen television technology, the 32 inch screen size is rapidly disappearing. Though considered bulky and thick compared with their LCD counterparts, some sets such as Panasonic's Z1 and Samsung's B860 series are as slim as 2.5 cm (1 in) thick making them comparable to LCDs in this respect.

Competing display technologies include Cathode Ray Tube ([CRT]), Organic Light Emitting Diode ([OLED]), AMLCD, Digital Light Processing DLP, SED-tv, LED display, field emission display (FED), and quantum dot display (QLED).

Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is a flat panel display, electronic visual display, or video display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly.

LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images which can be displayed or hidden, such as preset words, digits, and 7-segment displays as in a digital clock. They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made up of a large number of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.

LCDs are used in a wide range of applications including computer monitors, televisions, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, and signage. They are common in consumer devices such as DVD players, gaming devices, clocks, watches, calculators, and telephones, and have replaced Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays in most applications. They are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays, and since they do not use phosphors, they do not suffer image burn-in. LCDs are, however, susceptible to image persistence.

The LCD screen is more energy efficient and can be disposed of more safely than a CRT. Its low electrical power consumption enables it to be used in battery-powered electronic equipment. It is an electronically modulated optical device made up of any number of segments filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source (backlight) or reflector to produce images in colour or monochrome. Liquid crystals were first discovered in 1888. By 2008, annual sales of televisions with LCD screens exceeded sales of CRT units worldwide, and the CRT became obsolete for most purposes.

Computer Monitor
A monitor or a display is an electronic visual display for computers. The monitor comprises the display device, circuitry and an enclosure. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) thin panel, while older monitors used a Cathode Ray Tube ([CRT]) about as deep as the screen size.

Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. The common aspect ratio of televisions, and then computer monitors, has also changed from 4:3 to 16:9.

Computer Port
In computer hardware, a port serves as an interface between the computer and other computers or peripheral devices. In computer terms, a port generally refers to the female part of connection. Computer ports have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, speakers, or other peripheral devices. On the physical layer, a computer port is a specialised outlet on a piece of equipment to which a plug or cable connects. Electronically, the several conductors where the port and cable contacts connect, provide a method to transfer signals between devices.

FireWire
IEEE 1394 is an interface standard for a serial bus for high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data transfer. It was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by [Apple], who called it FireWire. The 1394 interface is comparable to [USB] though USB has more market share. Apple first included FireWire in some of its 1999 [Macintosh] models, and most Apple Macintosh computers manufactured in the years 2000 - 2011 included FireWire ports. However, in 2011 Apple began replacing Firewire with the [Thunderbolt] interface and, as of 2014, FireWire has been replaced by Thunderbolt on new Macs. The 1394 interface is also known by the brand i.LINK (Sony), and Lynx (Texas Instruments). IEEE 1394 replaced parallel SCSI in many applications, because of lower implementation costs and a simplified, more adaptable cabling system. The 1394 standard also defines a backplane interface, though this is not as widely used.

IEEE 1394 was the High-Definition Audio-Video Network Alliance (HANA) standard connection interface for A/V (audio/visual) component communication and control. (HANA was dissolved in September 2009 and the 1394 Trade Association assumed control of all HANA generated intellectual property). FireWire is also available in wireless, fiber optic, and coaxial versions using the isochronous protocols.

Digital Visual Interface (DVI)
Digital Visual Interface (DVI) is a video display interface developed by the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG). The digital interface is used to connect a video source, such as a display controller to a display device, such as a computer monitor. It was developed with the intention of creating an industry standard for the transfer of digital video content.

The interface is designed to transmit uncompressed digital video and can be configured to support multiple modes such as DVI-D (digital only), DVI-A (analog only), or DVI-I (digital and analog). Featuring support for analog connections, the DVI specification is compatible with the VGA interface. This compatibility, along with other advantages, led to its widespread acceptance over competing digital display standards Plug and Display (P&amp;D) and Digital Flat Panel (DFP). Although DVI is predominantly associated with computers, it is sometimes used in other consumer electronics such as television sets, video game consoles, and DVD players.

PS/2 connector
The PS/2 connector is a 6-pin mini-DIN connector used for connecting some keyboards and mice to a [PC compatible] computer system. Its name comes from the [IBM Personal System/2] series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older DE-9 RS-232 "serial mouse" connector, while the PS/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pin/180° DIN connector used in the [IBM PC/AT] design. The PS/2 designs on keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not be interchangeable since the two devices use a different set of commands.

HDMI
HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a proprietary audio / video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI compliant source device, such as a display controller, to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards.

HDMI implements the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, transport of compressed, uncompressed, and LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID. CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically compatible with the CEA-861 signals used by the digital visual interface (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one remote control handset.

Several versions of HDMI have been developed and deployed since initial release of the technology but all use the same cable and connector. Other than improved audio and video capacity, performance, resolution and colour spaces, newer versions have optional advanced features such as 3D, Ethernet data connection, and CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) extensions.

Production of consumer HDMI products started in late 2003. In Europe either DVI-HDCP or HDMI is included in the HD ready in-store labeling specification for TV sets for HDTV, formulated by EICTA with SES Astra in 2005. HDMI began to appear on consumer HDTV camcorders and digital still cameras in 2006. As of 8 January 2013 (ten years after the release of the first HDMI specification), over 3 billion HDMI devices have been sold.

Nvidia
Nvidia Corporation (commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylised as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nVidia) is an American worldwide technology company based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing market. Nvidia's primary GPU product line, labeled "[GeForce]", is in direct competition with [AMD]'s "[Radeon]" products. Nvidia also joined the gaming industry with its handheld Shield Portable and Shield Tablet, as well as the tablet market with the Tegra Note 7.

In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. In addition to [Advanced Micro Devices], its competitors include [Intel] and [Qualcomm].

ATI
ATI Technologies Inc (commonly referred to as ATI) was a semiconductor technology corporation based in Markham, Ontario, Canada, that specialised in the development of graphics processing units and chipsets. Founded in 1985 as Array Technology Inc, the company listed publicly in 1993. Advanced Micro Devices ([AMD]) acquired ATI in 2006. As a major fabrication less or fabless semiconductor company, ATI conducted research and development in-house and outsourced the manufacturing and assembly of its products. With the decline and eventual bankruptcy of 3dfx in 2000, ATI and its chief rival Nvidia emerged as the two dominant players in the graphics processors industry, eventually forcing other manufacturers into niche roles.

The acquisition of ATI in 2006 was important to AMD's strategic development of its Fusion generation of computer processors, which integrated general processing abilities with graphics processing functions within a single chip. Since 2010 AMD's graphics processor products have ceased using the ATI brand name.

DisplayPort
DisplayPort is a digital display interface developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association ([VESA]). The interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor, though it can also be used to carry audio, [USB], and other forms of data.

VESA designed it to replace [VGA], [DVI], and FPD-Link. DisplayPort is backward compatible with VGA and DVI through the use of adapters.

DisplayPort is the first display interface to rely on packetised data transmission, a form of digital communication found in technologies including [Ethernet], USB, and PCI Express. It allows both internal and external display connections and, unlike legacy standards where differential pairs are fixed to transmitting a clock signal with each output, the DisplayPort protocol is based on small data packets known as micro packets, which can embed the clock signal within the data stream, allowing higher resolutions with fewer pins. The use of data packets also allows DisplayPort to be extensible, meaning additional features can be added over time without significant changes to the physical interface itself.

DisplayPort can be used to transmit audio and video simultaneously, but each one is optional and can be transmitted without the other. The video signal path can have six to sixteen bits per color channel, and the audio path can have up to eight channels of 24-bit 192 kHz uncompressed PCM audio or can encapsulate compressed audio formats in the audio stream. A bi-directional, half-duplex auxiliary channel carries device management and device control data for the Main Link, such as VESA EDID, MCCS, and DPMS standards. In addition, the interface is capable of carrying bi-directional USB signals.

The DisplayPort LVDS signal protocol is not compatible with DVI or HDMI. However, Dual-mode DisplayPorts are designed to transmit a single-link DVI or HDMI 1.2/1.4 TMDS protocol across the interface through the use of an external passive adapter that selects the desired signal and converts it from 3.3 volts to 5 volts. Analog VGA and dual-link DVI require powered active adapters to convert the protocol and signal levels and do not rely on Dual-Mode. VGA adapters are powered by the DisplayPort connector, while dual-link DVI adapters may rely on an external power source (see Dual-mode).

The DisplayPort connector can have one, two, or four differential data pairs (lanes) in a Main Link, each with a raw bit rate of 1.62, 2.7, 5.4, or 8.1 Gbit/s per lane with self-clock running at 162, 270, 540, or 810 MHz. The effective data rates after decoding are 1.296, 2.16, 4.32, or 6.48 Gbit/s per lane (or 80% of the total), since data is 8b/10b encoded so each eight bits of information are encoded with a ten-bit symbol.

VESA
VESA or the Video Electronics Standards Association, is an international non-profit corporation standards body for computer graphics formed in 1988 by NEC Home Electronics, maker of the MultiSync monitor line, and eight video display adapter manufacturers: [ATI Technologies], Genoa Systems, Orchid Technology, Renaissance GRX, STB Systems, Tecmar, Video 7 and Western Digital/Paradise Systems.

VESA's initial goal was to produce a standard for 800x600 [SVGA] resolution video displays. Since then VESA has issued a number of standards, mostly relating to the function of video peripherals in personal computers.

In November 2010, VESA announced a cooperative agreement with the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig) for sharing technology expertise and specifications to develop multi-gigabit wireless DisplayPort capabilities. DisplayPort is a VESA technology that provides digital display connectivity for Monitor mount.
