Google Hangouts
Google Hangouts is a communication platform developed by [Google] which includes [instant messaging], video chat, SMS and [VoIP] features. It replaces three messaging products that Google had implemented concurrently within its services, including [Google Talk], Google+ Messenger (formerly: Huddle), and Hangouts, a video chat system present within Google+. Google has also stated that Hangouts is designed to be "the future" of its telephony product, Google Voice, and integrated some of the capabilities of Google Voice into Hangouts. In current versions of [Android], Hangouts is the default application for text messaging.

Prior to the launch of Hangouts, Google had maintained several similar, but technologically separate messaging services and platforms across its suite of products. These have included the enterprise oriented Google Talk (based on [XMPP]), Google+ Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which allows for group videoconferencing with up to 10 users at once. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as [Facebook Messenger], [iMessage], and [WhatsApp]. A decision was made to scrap the existing Google Talk system and code a new messaging product through a collaboration with multiple development teams.

Following reports that the new service would be known as "Babel", the service officially launched as Hangouts during the Google I/O conference on 15 May 2013.

iCal
Calendar, known as iCal before the release of [OS X Mountain Lion] in July 2012. Originally released as a free download for [Mac OS X] v10.2 on 10 September 2002, it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 1.5 with the release of Mac OS X v10.3. iCal was the first calendar application for OS X to offer support for multiple calendars and the ability to intermittently publish/subscribe to calendars on WebDAV servers. Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X v10.4, Version 3 as part of Mac OS X v10.5, Version 4 as part of Mac OS X v10.6, Version 5 as part of Mac OS X v10.7, Version 6 as part of OS X v10.8, Version 7 as part of OS X v10.9, and Version 8 as part of OS X v10.10.

[Apple] licensed the iCal name from Brown Bear Software, who have used it for their iCal application since 1997.

iCal's initial development was quite different from other Apple software: it was designed independently by a small French team working "secretly" in Paris, led by Jean-Marie Hullot, a friend of [Steve Jobs]. iCal's development has since been transferred to Apple US headquarters in Cupertino.

Google Groups
Google Groups is a service from [Google Inc] that provides discussion groups for people sharing common interests. The Groups service also provides a gateway to [Usenet] newsgroups via a shared user interface.

Google Groups became operational in February 2001, following Google's acquisition of Deja's Usenet archive. (Deja News had been operational since 1995.)

Google Groups offers at least two kinds of discussion group; in both cases users can participate in threaded conversations, either through a web interface or by e-mail. The first kind are forums specific to Google Groups which are inaccessible by NNTP and act more like mailing lists. The second kind are Usenet groups, for which Google Groups acts as gateway and unofficial archive (the Google Groups archive of Usenet newsgroup postings dates back to 1981). Through the Google Groups user interface, users can read and post to Usenet groups.

In addition to accessing Google and Usenet groups, registered users can also set up mailing list archives for e-mail lists that are hosted elsewhere.
