Node.js
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in [JavaScript], and can be run within the Node.js runtime on [OS X], [Microsoft Windows], [Linux], [FreeBSD], NonStop, IBM AIX, IBM System z and IBM i. Its work is hosted and supported by the Node.js Foundation, a Collaborative Project at Linux Foundation.

Node.js provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability. These technologies are commonly used for real-time web applications.

Node.js uses the [Google V8] [JavaScript engine] to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript. Node.js contains a built-in library to allow applications to act as a [Web server] without software such as [Apache HTTP Server] or [IIS].

Dojo JavaScript Toolkit
Dojo Toolkit is an open source modular [JavaScript] library (or more specifically JavaScript toolkit) designed to ease the rapid development of cross-platform, JavaScript / Ajax-based applications and web sites. It was started by Alex Russell, Dylan Schiemann, David Schontzler, and others in 2004 and is dual-licensed under the modified BSD license or the Academic Free License (≥ 2.1). The Dojo Foundation is a non-profit organisation created with the goal to promote the adoption of the toolkit.

MooTools JavaScript Framework
MooTools (My Object-Oriented Tools) is a lightweight, object-oriented, [JavaScript] framework. It is released under the free, open-source MIT License.

Valerio Proietti first authored the framework and released it in September 2006 taking as his inspiration [Prototype] and Dean Edward's [base2]. MooTools originated from Moo.fx, a popular plug-in Proietti produced for Prototype in October 2005, which is still maintained and used.

Whereas Prototype extended—prototyped—many of JavaScript's native String, Array, and Function objects with additional methods, Proietti desired a framework that (at the time) further extended the native Element object as well to offer greater control of the Document Object Model (DOM).

Components
MooTools includes a number of components, but not all need to be loaded for each application. Some of the component categories are:

- Core: A collection of utility functions that all the other components require.
- More: An official collection of add-ons that extend the Core and provide enhanced functionality.
- Class: The base library for Class object instantiation.
- Natives: A collection of JavaScript Native Object enhancements. The Natives add functionality, compatibility, and new methods that simplify coding.
- Element: Contains a large number of enhancements and compatibility standardization to the HTML Element object.
- Fx: An advanced effects-API to animate page elements.
- Request: Includes XHR interface, Cookie, JSON, and HTML retrieval-specific tools for developers to exploit.
- Window: Provides a cross-browser interface to client-specific information, such as the dimensions of the window.

Prototype JavaScript Framework 
The Prototype JavaScript Framework is a [JavaScript] framework created by Sam Stephenson in February 2005 as part of the foundation for [Ajax] support in [Ruby on Rails]. It is implemented as a single file of JavaScript code, usually named prototype.js. Prototype is distributed standalone, but also as part of larger projects, such as Ruby on Rails, [script.aculo.us] and Rico.
===

script.aculo.us
script.aculo.us is a [JavaScript] library built on the [Prototype] JavaScript Framework, providing dynamic visual effects and user interface elements via the Document Object Model (DOM).

It is most notably included with [Ruby on Rails] and Seaside, but also provided separately to work with other web application frameworks and scripting languages.

script.aculo.us was extracted by Thomas Fuchs from his work on fluxiom, a web based digital asset management tool by the design company wollzelle. It was first released to the public in June 2005.
===

YUI - Yahoo! User Interface Library
The Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI) is a discontinued open-source [JavaScript] library for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as [Ajax], [DHTML], and DOM scripting. YUI includes several core [CSS] resources. It is available under a BSD License. Development on YUI began in 2005 and [Yahoo!] properties such as My Yahoo! and the Yahoo! front page began using YUI in the summer of that year. YUI was released for public use in February 2006. It was actively developed by a core team of Yahoo! engineers.

In September 2009, Yahoo! released YUI 3, a new version of YUI rebuilt from the ground up to modernize the library and incorporate lessons learned from YUI 2. Among the enhancements are a CSS selector driven engine, like [jQuery], for retrieving DOM elements, a greater emphasis on granularity of modules, a smaller seed file that loads other modules when necessary, and a variety of syntactic changes intended to make writing code faster and easier.

The YUI Library project at Yahoo! was founded by Thomas Sha and sponsored internally by Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang; its principal architects have been Sha, Adam Moore, and Matt Sweeney. The library's developers maintain the YUIBlog; the YUI community discusses the library and implementations in its community forum.

On 29 August 2014, it was announced that active development of YUI by Yahoo! would end, citing the evolution of the JavaScript standards, steadily decreasing interest in large JavaScript libraries by developers, and the proliferation of server-side solutions. Future development will be limited to maintenance releases addressing issues which are "absolutely critical to Yahoo properties."

D3.js
D3.js (or just D3 for Data-Driven Documents) is a [JavaScript] library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualisations in [web browsers]. It makes use of the widely implemented [SVG], [HTML5], and [CSS] standards. It is the successor to the earlier Protovis framework. In contrast to many other libraries, D3.js allows great control over the final visual result. Its development was noted in 2011, as version 2.0.0 was released in August 2011.
===

SWFObject
SWFObject (originally FlashObject) is an open-source [JavaScript] library used to embed [Adobe Flash] content onto Web pages, which is supplied as one small JavaScript file. The library can also detect the installed [Adobe Flash Player] plug-in in all major web browsers, on all major operating systems (OS), and can redirect the visitor to another webpage or show alternate HTML content if the installed plug-in is not suitable.
===

AngularJS
AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular") is an open-source web application framework maintained by [Google] and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing [single-page applications]. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side [model–view–controller] (MVC) and [model-view-viewmodel] (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

The AngularJS library works by first reading the [HTML] page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard [JavaScript] variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic [JSON] resources.
===

Ext JS
Ext JS is a pure [JavaScript] application framework for building interactive web applications using techniques such as [Ajax], [DHTML] and DOM scripting.

Originally built as an add-on library extension of [YUI] by Jack Slocum, Ext JS includes interoperability with [jQuery] and [Prototype]. Beginning with version 1.1, Ext JS retains no dependencies on external libraries, instead making their use optional.
===

qooxdoo
qooxdoo is an open source [Ajax] web application framework. It is an LGPL and / or EPL licensed client-side and server-agnostic solution, and includes support for professional [JavaScript] development, a graphical user interface ([GUI]) toolkit and high-level client-server communication.

qooxdoo is entirely class-based, tries to leverage the features of object-oriented JavaScript and is based on namespaces. Most modern browsers are supported, including [Gecko] ([Firefox], Mozilla, SeaMonkey), [Presto] ([Opera]), [Trident] ([Internet Explorer], RealPlayer, Winamp), [WebKit] ([Chrome], [Safari]). It includes an API reference that is auto-generated from Javadoc-like comments. Among the accompanying tool set is a comprehensive JavaScript parser that is an integral part of the automatic build process and is used to optimize, compress, link and deploy custom applications, and generate documentation. Internationalisation and localisation of applications are supported.
===

Glow
Glow is an open-source [JavaScript] library created by the [BBC]. Development on Glow began in 2007, and it was publicly released under an Apache License in July 2009.

The rationale for the development of the library, as opposed to using other libraries such as [jQuery] or [YUI], was to meet the BBC's stated targets for cross-browser compatibility (particularly [Safari] 1.3) that are of particular use in creating a website that uses data that corresponds to times, for example broadcast metadata.
===

MochiKit
MochiKit is a light-weight [JavaScript] library written and maintained by Bob Ippolito.

Inspired by the [Python] networking framework, Twisted, it uses the concept of deferred execution to allow asynchronous behaviour. This has made it useful in the development of interactive web pages which maintain a dialog with the web server, sometimes called [Ajax] applications.

Of particular note is its ability to load and manipulate [JSON] encoded data sets, and MochiKit.DOM, a set of functions to easily create dynamic page components.

MochiKit forms the foundation of the client-side functionality of the TurboGears Python web-application stack. Perhaps as a result of the author's involvement in the Python community, MochiKit exhibits many idioms familiar to Python programmers, and is commonly used in Python-based web applications.
===

Underscore.js
Underscore.js is a [JavaScript] library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It is comparable to features provided by [Prototype.js] and the [Ruby] language, but opts for a functional programming design instead of extending object prototypes. For example, Underscore.js's _.each function delegates to the host environment's native forEach implementation when present, or a compatible version when absent. The documentation refers to Underscore.js as "the tie to go along with [jQuery]'s tux, and [Backbone.js]'s suspenders." Underscore.js was created by Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also known for Backbone.js and [CoffeeScript].
===

Backbone.js 
Backbone.js is a [JavaScript] library with a [RESTful] [JSON] interface and is based on the [model–view–presenter] (MVP) application design paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only dependency is on one JavaScript library, [Underscore.js]. It is designed for developing [single-page web applications], and for keeping various parts of web applications (e.g. multiple clients and the server) synchronised. Backbone was created by Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also known for [CoffeeScript].
===

Ember.js
Ember.js is an open-source [JavaScript] web application framework. It is based on the [model-view-controller] (MVC) software architectural pattern. It allows developers to create scalable [single-page applications] by incorporating common idioms and best practices into the framework. It provides a rich object model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, automatically-updating templates powered by HTMLBars, and a router for managing application state.
===

JavaScriptMVC
JavaScriptMVC is an open-source rich Internet application framework based on [jQuery] and [OpenAjax]. It extends those libraries with a [model–view–controller] architecture and tools for testing and deployment. As it does not depend on server components, it can be combined with any web service interface and server-side language like [ASP.NET], [Java], [Perl], [PHP], [Python], or [Ruby].
===

Knockout
Knockout is a standalone [JavaScript] implementation of the [Model-View-ViewModel] pattern with templates. The underlying principles are therefore:

- a clear separation between domain data, view components and data to be displayed
- the presence of a clearly defined layer of specialized code to manage the relationships between the view components

The latter leverages the native event management features of the JavaScript language.

These features streamline and simplify the specification of complex relationships between view components, which in turn make the display more responsive and the user experience richer.
===

Modernizr
Modernizr is a [JavaScript] library which is designed to detect [HTML5] and [CSS3] features in various browsers. Since the specifications for both HTML5 and CSS3 are only partially implemented or nonexistent in many browsers, it can be difficult to determine which techniques are available for use in rendering a page, and when it is necessary to avoid using a feature or to load a workaround such as a shim to emulate the feature. Modernizr aims to provide this feature detection in a complete and standardised manner.

===

Shim
In computer programming, a shim is a small library that transparently intercepts [API] calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation elsewhere. Shims typically come about when the behaviour of an API changes, thereby causing compatibility issues for older applications which still rely on the older functionality. In such cases, the older API can still be supported by a thin compatibility layer on top of the newer code. [Web polyfills] are a related concept. Shims can also be used for running programs on different software platforms than they were developed for.
===

HTML5Shiv
HTML5Shiv is a [JavaScript] workaround, created by Sjoerd Visscher, to enable styling of [HTML5] elements in versions of [Internet Explorer] prior to version 9, which do not allow unknown elements to be styled without [JavaScript].

Prior to version 9 of Internet Explorer there was little to no support for HTML5 elements and other HTML5 features.

Internet Explorer commands a large percentage of the usage share of web browsers. Within the Internet Explorer percentage, most of its current usage as of February 2013 comes from version 9, with version 8 holding the second-highest and version 7 the third-highest value. With its high usage percentage, it is important to ensure that web pages function correctly in Internet Explorer. HTML5Shiv allows versions of Internet Explorer prior to version 9 to recognise the HTML5 tags and allows them to be styled using CSS.
===

Web Polyfill
In web development, a polyfill (or polyfiller) is downloadable code which provides facilities that are not built into a [web browser]. It implements technology that a developer expects the browser to provide natively, providing a more uniform API landscape. For example, many features of HTML5 are not supported by versions of [Internet Explorer] older than version 8 or 9, but can be used by web pages if those pages install a polyfill. Web [shims] and HTML5 Shivs are related concepts.

The term originated with Remy Sharp who required a word that meant “replicate an API using JavaScript (or [Flash] or whatever) if the browser doesn’t have it natively” while co-writing the book 'Introducing HTML5' in 2009. Shim, to him, meant a piece of code that you could add that would fix some functionality, but it would most often have its own API, thus did not fulfil Sharp's terminology requirements. The terms progressive enhancement and graceful degradation similarly did not meet his needs since they didn't specifically require, nor were they specific to, JavaScript.

Sharp decided upon the term polyfill that can imply filling in missing browser functionality and using any number of techniques (poly can mean “many” in Greek). Polyfilla, a paste used to cover up cracks and holes in walls, was also a visualisation that Sharp found fitting for the term. He has received feedback stating that the “word should be changed”, but the term has now grown more popular amongst web developers. Sharp intentionally did not promote the term widely, only using it in specific cases and believes that it received a large amount of exposure after Paul Irish directly referenced the term in a presentation months after its inception and was helped become popular due to [Modernizr]'s “HTML5 shims & polyfill” page.

Examples

html5shiv
In IE versions prior to 9, unknown HTML elements like <section> and <nav> would be parsed as empty elements, breaking the page's nesting structure and making those elements impossible to style using CSS. One of the most widely used polyfills, html5shiv exploits another quirk of IE to work around this bug: calling document.createElement("tagname") for each of the new HTML5 elements, which causes IE to parse them correctly. It also includes basic default styling for those HTML5 elements.

-prefix-free
Though most polyfills target out-of-date browsers, some exist to simply push modern browsers forward a little bit more. Lea Verou's -prefix-free polyfill is such a polyfill, allowing current browsers to recognise the unprefixed versions of several CSS3 properties instead of requiring the developer to write out all the vendor prefixes. It reads the page's stylesheets and replaces any unprefixed properties with their prefixed counterparts recognised by the current browser.

Selectivizr
Keith Clark's Selectivizr is a popular polyfill that makes many CSS3 selectors work in IE 8 and below. It reads the page's stylesheets looking for a number of known CSS3 selectors, then uses a JavaScript selector library to query the document for elements matching those selectors, applying the styles directly to those elements. It supports several JavaScript selector libraries such as jQuery.

Flexie
Possibly one of the most anticipated features of CSS3, Flexible Box Layout (a.k.a. Flexbox) promises to be an extremely powerful tool for laying out interface elements. WebKit and Mozilla engines have supported a preliminary draft syntax for years. Flexie implements support for that same syntax in IE and Opera. However, the draft spec has undergone a drastic revision to a new (and much more powerful) syntax, which is not yet supported by Flexie. Flexie can still be used along with the old syntax, but the developer must make sure they include the new syntax for future browsers as well.

CSS3 PIE
PIE ("Progressive Internet Explorer") implements some of the most popular missing CSS3 box decoration properties in IE, including border-radius and box-shadow for IE 8 and below, and linear-gradient backgrounds for IE 9 and below. Invoked as a HTC behavior (a proprietary IE feature), it looks for the unsupported CSS3 properties on specific elements and renders those properties using VML for IE 6-8 and SVG for IE 9. Its rendering is mostly indistinguishable from native browser implementations and it handles dynamic DOM modification well.

JSON 2
Douglas Crockford originally wrote json2.js as an API for reading and writing his (then up-and-coming) JSON data format. It became so widely used that browser vendors decided to implement its API natively and turn it into a de facto standard; json2.js was transformed from a library to a polyfill after the fact.[clarification needed]

es5-shim
ECMAScript 5th Edition ("ES5") brings some useful new scripting features, and since they're syntactically compatible with older JavaScript engines they can mostly be polyfilled by patching methods onto built-in JS objects. This es5-shim polyfill does it in two parts: es5-shim.js contains those methods that can be fully polyfilled, and es5-sham.js contains partial implementations of the other methods which rely too much on the underlying engine to work accurately.

FlashCanvas
FlashCanvas is an implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API using a Flash plug-in. A rare commercial polyfill, it comes in a paid version, as well as a free version, which lacks a few advanced features like shadows.

MediaElement.js
John Dyer's MediaElement.js polyfills support for <video> and <audio> elements, including the HTML5 MediaElement API, in older browsers using Flash or Silverlight plug-ins. It also provides an optional media player UI for those elements, which is consistent across all browsers.

Webshims Lib
Alexander Farkas's Webshims Lib aggregates many other polyfills together into a single package and conditionally loads only those needed by the visiting browser.
===

Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
Object Relational Mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R Mapping) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to create their own ORM tools.

In object-oriented programming, data management tasks act on object-oriented (OO) objects that are almost always non-scalar values. For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a "Person object" with attributes/fields to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person's name, a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain "PhoneNumber objects" and so on. The address book entry is treated as a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as a method to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on.

However, many popular database products such as structured query language database management systems (SQL DBMS) can only store and manipulate scalar values such as integers and strings organized within tables. The programmer must either convert the object values into groups of simpler values for storage in the database (and convert them back upon retrieval), or only use simple scalar values within the program. Object-relational mapping is used to implement the first approach.[1]

The heart of the problem is translating the logical representation of the objects into an atomised form that is capable of being stored in the database, while preserving the properties of the objects and their relationships so that they can be reloaded as objects when needed. If this storage and retrieval functionality is implemented, the objects are said to be persistent.

Windows 8.1
Windows 8.1 (codenamed Blue) is an upgrade for [Windows 8], a version of [Windows NT], a computer operating system released by [Microsoft].

First unveiled and released as a public beta in June 2013, it was released to manufacturing on 27 August 2013, and reached general availability on 17 October 2013, almost a year after the retail release of its predecessor. Windows 8.1 is available free of charge for retail copies of [Windows 8] and [Windows RT] users via the Windows Store. Unlike service packs on previous versions of Windows, users who obtained 8 outside of retail copies or pre-loaded installations (i.e., volume licensing) must obtain 8.1 through new installation media from their respective subscription or enterprise channel. Microsoft's support lifecycle policy treats Windows 8.1 similar to previous service packs of Windows: It is part of Windows 8's support lifecycle, and installing 8.1 is required to maintain access to support and Windows updates after 12 January 2016. However, unlike previous service packs, Windows 8.1 cannot be acquired via Windows Update and only accepts 8.1 specific product keys.

Released as part of a shift by Microsoft towards regular yearly major updates for its software platforms and services, Windows 8.1 aims to address complaints of Windows 8 users and reviewers on launch. Visible enhancements include an improved Start screen, additional snap views, additional bundled apps, tighter [OneDrive] (formerly SkyDrive) integration, [Internet Explorer 11], a [Bing] powered unified search system, restoration of a visible Start button on the taskbar, and the ability to restore the previous behaviour of opening the user's desktop on login instead of the Start screen. Windows 8.1 also added support for such emerging technologies as high-resolution displays, 3D printing, Wi-Fi Direct, and Miracast streaming.

Windows 8.1 received relatively positive reception, with critics praising the expanded functionality available to apps in comparison to 8, its OneDrive integration, along with its user interface tweaks and the addition of expanded tutorials for operating the Windows 8 interface. Despite these improvements, 8.1 was still criticized for not addressing all digressions of Windows 8 (such as a poor level of integration between Metro-style apps and the desktop interface), and the potential privacy implications of the expanded use of online services.
===

Windows RT
Windows RT is an edition of [Windows 8] and [Windows 8.1] designed for mobile devices (primarily tablet computers) that use 32-bit [ARM] architecture (ARMv7).

[Microsoft] intended for devices with Windows RT to take advantage of the architecture's power efficiency to allow for longer battery life, to use system-on-chip (SoC) designs to allow for thinner devices, and to provide a "reliable" experience over time. In comparison to other mobile operating systems, Windows RT also supports a relatively large number of existing USB peripherals and accessories, and includes a version of [Microsoft Office] 2013 optimised for ARM devices as pre-loaded software. However, while Windows RT inherits the appearance and functionality of Windows 8, it contains a number of limitations, which includes only being capable of executing software that is digitally signed by Microsoft (which includes pre-loaded software and software obtained from Windows Store), and lacking certain enterprise-oriented features.

===

Windows API
The Windows API, informally WinAPI, is [Microsoft]'s core set of application programming interfaces (APIs) available in the [Microsoft Windows] operating systems. The name Windows API collectively refers to a number of different platform implementations that are often referred to by their own names (for example, Win32 API); see the versions section. Almost all Windows programs interact with the Windows API; on the [Windows NT] line of operating systems, a small number (such as programs started early in the Windows startup process) use the Native API.

Developer support is available in the form of the [Windows Software Development Kit] (SDK), providing documentation and tools necessary to build software based upon the Windows API and associated Windows interfaces.

The Windows API (Win32) is primarily focused on the [C] programming language in that its exposed functions and data structures are described in that language in recent versions of its documentation. However, the API may be used by any programming language compiler or assembler capable of handling the (well defined) low level data structures along with the prescribed calling conventions for calls and callbacks. Similarly, the internal implementation of the API's functionality has been developed in several languages, historically. Despite the fact that C lacks any notion of object-oriented programming, the Windows API as well as Windows itself has sometimes been described as object-oriented. There have also been many wrapper classes and extensions (from Microsoft or other sources) for object oriented languages that makes this object oriented structure more explicit ([MSFC], [VCL], [GDI+], etc.). For instance, [Windows 8], while still providing the Windows API, also provides the WinRT API which is implemented in [C++] and is object-oriented by its design.
===

Windows Server
Windows Server is a brand name for a group of server [operating systems] released by [Microsoft].

It includes all [Windows] operating systems that have "Windows Server" in their names, but not any other Microsoft product.

This brand includes the following operating systems:

- [Windows Server 2008 R2] (July 2009)
- [Windows Server 2012] (August 2012)
- [Windows Server 2012 R2] (October 2013)
- [Windows Server 2016] (upcoming)

Microsoft has also produced [Windows Server Essentials] (formerly Windows Small Business Server) and [Windows Essential Business Server] (discontinued), software bundles which includes a Windows Server operating system and some other Microsoft Servers products.

Older server operating systems: [Windows NT 3.1], [Windows NT 3.5], [Windows NT 3.51], [Windows NT 4.0], [Windows 2000 Server] and [Windows Home Server]
===

Windows Server Essentials
Windows Server Essentials (formerly Windows Small Business Server or SBS) is an integrated server suite from Microsoft designed for running network infrastructure (both intranet management and Internet access) of small and midsize businesses having no more than 25 users or 50 devices. Application server technologies are tightly integrated to provide, e.g., the Remote Web Workplace, and offer management benefits such as integrated setup, enhanced monitoring, a unified management console, and remote access.
===

Windows Essential Business Server 2008
Windows Essential Business Server 2008 (code named Centro) was [Microsoft]'s server offering for mid-size businesses (up to a maximum of 300 Users and / or Devices). It was released to manufacturing on 15 September 2008 and was officially launched on 12 November 2008. It was discontinued on 30 June 2010.
===

Windows Server 2003
Windows Server 2003 (sometimes referred to as Win2K3) is a server operating system produced by [Microsoft], released on 24 April 2003. An updated version, [Windows Server 2003 R2], was released to manufacturing on 6 December 2005. Its successor, [Windows Server 2008], was released on 4 February 2008. It is based on [Windows XP], basically becoming an enhanced version of XP. According to Microsoft, Windows Server 2003 is more scalable and delivers better performance than its predecessor, [Windows 2000].

[Windows Vista], as shipped, was developed based solely on Windows Server 2003 source code.
===

Windows Server 2003 R2 
Windows Server 2003 R2 is the successor of [Windows Server 2003], released to manufacturing on 6 December 2005. It was released for x86 and x64 platforms, but not for IA-64. It is distributed on two CDs, with one CD being the Windows Server 2003 SP1 CD. The other CD adds many optionally installable features for Windows Server 2003 R2.

===
Windows Server 2008
Windows Server 2008 (sometimes abbreviated as "Win2K8" or "W2K8") is one of [Microsoft Windows]' server line of operating systems. Released to manufacturing on 4 February 2008, and officially released on 27 February 2008, it is the successor to [Windows Server 2003], released nearly five years earlier. A second release, named [Windows Server 2008 R2], was released to manufacturing on 22 July 2009.
===

Windows Server 2008 R2
Windows Server 2008 R2 is a server operating system produced by [Microsoft]. It was released to manufacturing on 22 July 2009 and launched on 22 October 2009. According to the Windows Server Team blog, the retail availability was 14 September 2009. It is built on [Windows NT 6.1], the same kernel used with the client-oriented [Windows 7]. It is the first 64-bit-only operating system released from Microsoft. Version enhancements include new functionality for Active Directory, new virtualisation and management features, version 7.5 of [Microsoft IIS] Web Server and support for up to 256 logical processors.

There are seven editions: Foundation, Standard, Enterprise, Datacenter, Web, HPC Server, Itanium and Windows Storage Server 2008 R2 (Essentials Edition).
===

Windows Server 2012
Windows Server 2012, codenamed "Windows Server 8", is the sixth release of [Windows Server]. It is the server version of [Windows 8] and succeeds [Windows Server 2008 R2]. Two pre-release versions, a developer preview and a beta version, were released during development. The software was generally available to customers starting on 4 September 2012.

Unlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2012 has no support for Itanium-based computers, and has four editions. Various features were added or improved over Windows Server 2008 R2 (with many placing an emphasis on cloud computing), such as an updated version of [Hyper-V], an IP address management role, a new version of Windows Task Manager, and ReFS, a new file system. Windows Server 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in [Windows 8].

The successor to Windows Server 2012, called [Windows Server 2012 R2], was released along with [Windows 8.1] in October 2013. A service pack, formally designated Windows Server 2012 R2 Update, was released in April 2014.
===

Windows Server 2012 R2
Windows Server 2012 R2 was released on 18 October 2013. It was unveiled on 3 June 2013 at TechEd North America. According to Windows Server 2012 R2 datasheet published on 31 May 2013, there are four editions of this operating system: Foundation, Essentials, Standard and Datacenter. As with [Windows Server 2012], the Datacenter and Standard editions are feature identical, varying only based on licensing (particularly licensing of virtual instances). The Essentials edition has the same features as the Datacenter and Standard products, with some restrictions.

A further update, formally designated Windows Server 2012 R2 Update, was released in April 2014.

Changes from Windows Server 2012

- Faster VM deployment (approximately half the time)
- Internet Information Services 8.5: Support for logging to Event Tracing for Windows and the ability to log any request/response headers. To improve scalability, if IIS is configured with 100 or more web sites, by default it will not automatically start any of them. Alongside this, a new "Idle Worker Process Page-Out" configuration option has been added to application pools to instruct Windows to page-out the process if it has been idle for the idle time-out period (by default, 20 minutes).
- Server Message Block: Performance and event logging quality improvements, support for Hyper-V Live Migration over SMB, bandwidth prioritization management, and the ability to remove SMB 1.0 support
- Windows Deployment Services: Support for managing WDS via PowerShell.
- Windows Defender is available in a Server Core installation, and is installed and enabled by default.
- IP Address Management (IPAM): Extended to support role-based access control, allowing for fine-grained control over which users can view or change configurations for DHCP reservations, scopes, IP address blocks, DNS resource records, etc. Additionally, IPAM can integrate with System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 R2 to have coordinated IP policy across both physical and virtual environments. The IPAM database can be stored in a SQL Server instance instead of Windows Internal Database.
- Group Policy has a new "Policy Cache" setting which allows domain-joined machines to store a copy of the group policy settings on the client machine and, depending on the speed of access to the domain controller, use those at startup time instead of waiting for the policy settings to download. This can improve startup times on machines that are disconnected from the company network.[77] New Group Policy settings have been added to cover new features in Windows 8.1 and Internet Explorer 11, such as enabling/disabling SPDY/3 support, configuring start screen layouts, and detecting phone numbers in web pages.
- TLS support is extended to support RFC 5077, "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without Server-Side State", which improves performance of long-running TLS-secured connections that need to reconnect due to session expiration.
- Hyper-V role and Hyper-V management console are added to the Essentials edition.

Windows 2000 Server
[Microsoft] released various editions of Windows 2000 for different markets and business needs: Professional, Server, Advanced Server and Datacenter Server. Each was packaged separately.

Windows 2000 Professional was designed as the desktop operating system for businesses and power users. It is the client version of Windows 2000. It offers greater security and stability than many of the previous Windows desktop operating systems. It supports up to two processors, and can address up to 4GB of RAM. The system requirements are a Pentium processor (or equivalent) of 133 MHz or greater, at least 32MB of RAM, 650MB of hard drive space, and a CD-ROM drive (recommended: Pentium II, 128MB of RAM, 2GB of hard drive space, and CD-ROM drive).

Windows 2000 Server shares the same user interface with Windows 2000 Professional, but contains additional components for the computer to perform server roles and run infrastructure and application software. A significant new component introduced in the server versions is Active Directory, which is an enterprise-wide directory service based on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). Additionally, Microsoft integrated Kerberos network authentication, replacing the often-criticised NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication system used in previous versions. This also provided a purely transitive-trust relationship between Windows 2000 domains in a forest (a collection of one or more Windows 2000 domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog, being linked with two-way transitive trusts). Furthermore, Windows 2000 introduced a Domain Name Server which allows dynamic registration of IP addresses. Windows 2000 Server supports up to 4 processors and 4GB of RAM, with a minimum requirement of 128MB of RAM and 1GB hard disk space, however requirements may be higher depending on installed components.

Windows 2000 Advanced Server is a variant of Windows 2000 Server operating system designed for medium-to-large businesses. It offers clustering infrastructure for high availability and scalability of applications and services, including support for up to 8 CPUs, a main memory amount of up to 8GB on Physical Address Extension (PAE) systems and the ability to do 8-way SMP. It supports TCP/IP load balancing and enhanced two-node server clusters based on the Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) in [Windows NT Server 4.0] Enterprise Edition. System requirements are similar to those of Windows 2000 Server, however they may need to be higher to scale to larger infrastructure.

Windows 2000 Datacenter Server is a variant of Windows 2000 Server designed for large businesses that move large quantities of confidential or sensitive data frequently via a central server. Like Advanced Server, it supports clustering, failover and load balancing. Its minimum system requirements are normal, but it was designed to be capable of handing advanced, fault-tolerant and scalable hardware—for instance computers with up to 32 CPUs and 32GB RAM, with rigorous system testing and qualification, hardware partitioning, coordinated maintenance and change control. System requirements are similar to those of Windows 2000 Advanced Server, however they may need to be higher to scale to larger infrastructure. Windows 2000 Datacenter Server was released to manufacturing on 11 August 2000 and launched on 26 September 2000. This edition was based on Windows 2000 with Service Pack 1 and was not available at retail.

Windows NT
Windows NT is a family of [operating systems] produced by [Microsoft], the first version of which was released in July 1993. It is a processor-independent, multiprocessing, multi-user operating system.

The first version of Windows NT was [Windows NT 3.1] and was produced for workstations and server computers. It was intended to complement consumer versions of Windows (including [Windows 1.0] through [Windows 3.1x]) that were based on [MS-DOS]. Gradually, the Windows NT family was expanded into Microsoft's general-purpose operating system product line for all personal computers, deprecating the [Windows 9x] family.

"NT" was formerly expanded to "New Technology" but no longer carries any specific meaning. Starting with [Windows 2000], "NT" was removed from the product name and is only included in the product version string.

NT was the first purely 32-bit version of Windows, whereas its consumer-oriented counterparts, Windows 3.1x and Windows 9x, were 16-bit / 32-bit hybrids. It is a multi-architecture operating system. Initially, it supported several CPU architectures, including IA-32, MIPS, DEC Alpha and PowerPC. The latest versions support x86 (more specifically IA-32 and x64) and ARM. Major features of Windows NT family include Windows Shell, [Windows API], Native API, Active Directory, Group Policy, Hardware Abstraction Layer, NTFS file system, BitLocker, Windows Store, Windows Update, and [Hyper-V].

Windows NT 3.1 
Windows NT 3.1 is a 32-bit operating system developed by [Microsoft]. It constitutes the first operating system of the [Windows NT] family and was released on 27 July 1993. Although it is the first version in the NT line, the name was chosen as a brand extension of the similar [Windows 3.1].

The architecture of Windows NT 3.1 was designed from scratch, and was originally intended to be a rewrite of the [OS/2] operating system that Microsoft had co-developed with [IBM]; however, the popularity of [Windows 3.0] resulted in a change to a more Windows-like architecture, a change which subsequently resulted in IBM discontinuing its partnership with Microsoft. The central design goals were portability to multiple processor architectures, as well as higher security and stability than the previous [DOS]-based operating systems. Windows NT 3.1 was released in a workstation variant, called just Windows NT 3.1, and a server variant called Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server.

The operating system's success on the market was only limited, mostly due to the high system requirements for its time and the lack of 32-bit applications which used the capabilities of Windows NT 3.1. Nevertheless, the operating system laid the foundation for all future releases of the Windows NT line.

Windows NT 3.5
Windows NT 3.5 is an [operating system] developed by [Microsoft], released on 21 September 1994. It is the second release of [Windows NT].

One of the primary goals during Windows NT 3.5 development was to improve the operating system's performance. As a result, the project was codenamed "Daytona" in reference to the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida.
===

Windows NT 3.51
Windows NT 3.51 is the third release of [Microsoft's Windows NT] line of [operating systems]. It was released on 30 May 1995, nine months after [Windows NT 3.5], and three months before the release of [Windows 95]. The release provided two notable feature improvements; firstly NT 3.51 was the first of a short-lived outing of [Microsoft Windows] on the [PowerPC] architecture. The second most significant enhancement offered through the release was that it provides client/server support for interoperating with Windows 95, which was released three months after NT 3.51. [Windows NT 4.0] became its successor a year later; Microsoft continued to support Windows NT 3.51 until 31 December 2001.

Windows NT 4.0
Windows NT 4.0 is a graphical [operating system], designed to work with either uniprocessor or symmetric multi-processor computers. It was part of [Microsoft]'s [Windows NT] line of operating systems and was released to manufacturing on 31 July 1996. It is a 32-bit Windows system available in both workstation and server editions with a graphical environment similar to that of [Windows 95].

The successor to [Windows NT 3.51], Windows NT 4.0 introduced the user interface of Windows 95 to the Windows NT product line, including the Windows Shell, Windows Explorer (known as Windows NT Explorer), and the use of "My" nomenclature (e.g. My Computer). It also includes most applications introduced with Windows 95. Internally, Windows NT 4.0 was known as the Shell Update Release (SUR). Various administrative tools, notably User Manager for Domains, Server Manager and Domain Name Service Manager have improved graphical user interfaces. The Start Menu in Windows NT 4.0 separated the per-user shortcuts and folders from the All users shortcuts and folders by a separator line. Windows NT 4.0 includes some enhancements from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 such as the Space Cadet pinball table, font smoothing, full window drag, high color icons and stretching the wallpaper to fit the screen. Windows Desktop Update could also be installed on Windows NT 4.0 to update the shell version and install Task Scheduler. The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit included the Desktop Themes utility.

Windows NT 4.0 is the last major release of Microsoft Windows to support the Alpha, MIPS or PowerPC CPU architectures. It remained in use by businesses for a number of years, despite Microsoft's many efforts to get customers to upgrade to [Windows 2000] and newer versions. It was also the last release in the Windows NT line to be branded as Windows NT.

Hyper-V
Hyper-V, codenamed Viridian and formerly known as Windows Server Virtualization, is a native hypervisor; it can create virtual machines on x86-64 systems. Starting with [Windows 8], Hyper-V supersedes [Windows Virtual PC] as the hardware virtualisation component of the client editions of Windows NT. A server computer running Hyper-V can be configured to expose individual virtual machines to one or more networks.

Hyper-V was first released alongside [Windows Server 2008] and has since become a staple of the [Windows Server] family.
