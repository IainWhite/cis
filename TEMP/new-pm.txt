POSIX
POSIX an acronym for Portable Operating System Interface, is a family of standards specified by the [IEEE Computer Society] for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of [Unix] and other operating systems.

Linux Distribution 
A Linux distribution (often called a distro for short) is an operating system made as a software collection based on the [Linux] kernel and, often, on a package management system. Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers to powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).

A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most common being the [X Window System]), a window manager, and a desktop environment. Most of the included software is free and open-source software made available both as compiled binaries and in source code form, allowing modifications to the original software. Usually, Linux distributions optionally include some proprietary software that may not be available in source code form, such as binary blobs required for some device drivers. Almost all Linux distributions are [Unix-like]; the most notable exception is [Android], which does not include a command-line interface and programs made for typical Linux distributions.

A Linux distribution may also be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged together with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet the needs of many users. The software is usually adapted to the distribution and then packaged into software packages by the distribution's maintainers. The software packages are available online in so-called repositories, which are storage locations usually distributed around the world. Beside glue components, such as the distribution installers (for example, Debian-Installer and Anaconda) or the package management systems, there are only very few packages that are originally written from the ground up by the maintainers of a Linux distribution.

More than six hundred Linux distributions exist; over three hundred of those are in active development, constantly being revised and improved. Because of the huge availability of software, distributions have taken a wide variety of forms, including those suitable for use on desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones and tablets, as well as minimal environments typically for use in embedded systems. There are commercially backed distributions, such as [Fedora] (Red Hat), [openSUSE] (SUSE) and [Ubuntu] (Canonical Ltd.), and entirely community driven distributions, such as [Debian], [Slackware], [Gentoo] and [Arch Linux]. Most distributions come ready to use and pre-compiled for a specific instruction set, while some distributions (such as Gentoo) are distributed mostly in source code form and compiled locally during installation.

Yum - Yellowdog Updater, Modified
The Yellowdog Updater, Modified (yum) is an open-source command-line package-management utility for [Linux] operating systems using the [RPM] Package Manager. Though yum has a command-line interface, several other tools provide graphical user interfaces to yum functionality.

Yum allows automatic updates, package and dependency management, on RPM-based distributions. Like the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) from [Debian], yum works with software repositories (collections of packages), which can be accessed locally or over a network connection.

Under the hood, yum depends on RPM, which is a packaging standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digisigs to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither yum nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by endusers. Yum is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as Yum Extender (yumex) also exist. A rewrite of yum based on libsolv named DNF is currently being developed and expected to replace yum as the default package manager in Fedora 22.

RPM Package Manager 
RPM Package Manager (RPM) (originally Red Hat Package Manager; now a recursive initialism) is a package management system. The name RPM variously refers to the .rpm file format, files in this format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager itself. RPM was intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base.

Even though it was created for use in Red Hat Linux, RPM is now used in many GNU/Linux distributions. It has also been ported to some other operating systems, such as Novell NetWare (as of version 6.5 SP3) and IBM's AIX (as of version 4).

16-bit
In computer architecture, 16-bit integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are at most 16 bits (2 octets) wide. Also, 16-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 16-bit is also a term given to a generation of microcomputers in which 16-bit microprocessors were the norm.

A 16-bit register can store 216 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 through 32,767 (unsigned: 0 through 65,535). Hence, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64KB of byte addressable memory.
===

32-bit
In computer architecture, 32-bit integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are at most 32 bits (4 octets) wide. Also, 32-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 32-bit is also a term given to a generation of microcomputers in which 32-bit microprocessors are the norm.

A 32-bit register can store 232 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 32 bits is -2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647 (unsigned: 0 through 4,294,967,295). Hence, a processor with 32-bit memory addresses can directly access 4GB of byte addressable memory.
===

8-bit
In computer architecture, 8-bit integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are at most 8 bits (1 octet) wide. Also, 8-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 8-bit is also a term given to a generation of microcomputers in which 8-bit microprocessors were the norm.

The [IBM System/360] introduced byte addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit addressable or decimal digit addressable or word addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.

The first widely adopted 8-bit microprocessor was the [Intel 8080], being used in many hobbyist computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, often running the [CP/M] operating system; it had 8-bit data words and 16-bit addresses. The [Zilog Z80] (compatible with the 8080) and the [Motorola 6800] were also used in similar computers. The Z80 and the [MOS Technology 6502] 8-bit CPUs were widely used in home computers and second and third generation game consoles of the '70s and '80s. Many 8-bit CPUs or microcontrollers are the basis of today's ubiquitous embedded systems.

64-bit
In computer architecture, 64-bit computing is the use of processors that have datapath widths, integer size, and memory address widths of 64 bits (eight octets). Also, 64-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. From the software perspective, 64-bit computing means the use of code with 64-bit virtual memory addresses.

The term 64-bit describes a generation of computers in which 64-bit processors are the norm. 64 bits is a word size that defines certain classes of computer architecture, buses, memory and CPUs, and by extension the software that runs on them. 64-bit CPUs have been used in supercomputers since the 1970s (Cray-1, 1975) and in RISC-based workstations and servers since the early 1990s, notably the MIPS R4000, R8000, and R10000, the [DEC Alpha], the Sun UltraSPARC, and the IBM RS64 and POWER3 and later POWER microprocessors. In 2001 NEC released a 64 bit RISC CPU for mobile devices, notably the low cost Casio BE-300. In 2003 64-bit CPUs were introduced to the (previously 32-bit) mainstream personal computer arena in the form of the [x86-64] and 64-bit [PowerPC] processor architectures and in 2012 even into the ARM architecture targeting smartphones and tablet computers, first sold on 20 September 2013 in the [iPhone] 5S powered by the ARMv8-A Apple A7 SoC.

A 64-bit register can store 264 (over 18 quintillion or 1.8Ã—1019) different values. Hence, a processor with 64-bit memory addresses can directly access 264 bytes (=16 exbibytes) of byte-addressable memory.

Without further qualification, a 64-bit computer architecture generally has integer and addressing registers that are 64 bits wide, allowing direct support for 64-bit data types and addresses. However, a CPU might have external data buses or address buses with different sizes from the registers, even larger (the 32-bit Pentium had a 64-bit data bus, for instance). The term may also refer to the size of low-level data types, such as 64-bit floating-point numbers.

Computer Architecture
Computer architecture is a set of disciplines that describe the functionality, organisation and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other descriptions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.

AMD K5
The K5 was [AMD]'s first [x86] processor to be developed entirely in-house. Introduced in March 1996, its primary competition was [Intel]'s [Pentium] microprocessor. The K5 was an ambitious design, closer to a [Pentium Pro] than a Pentium regarding technical solutions and internal architecture. However, the final product was closer to the Pentium regarding performance, although faster clock for clock compared to the Pentium.
===

AMD K6
The K6 microprocessor was launched by [AMD] in 1997. The main advantage of this particular microprocessor is that it was designed to fit into existing desktop designs for [Pentium] branded CPUs. It was marketed as a product which could perform as well as its [Intel Pentium II] equivalent but at a significantly lower price. The K6 had a considerable impact on the [PC] market and presented [Intel] with serious competition.

AMD Athlon
Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of [x86-compatible] microprocessors designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices ([AMD]). The original Athlon (now called Athlon Classic) was the first seventh generation x86 processor. The original Athlon was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz). AMD has continued using the Athlon name with the Athlon 64, an eighth generation processor featuring [x86-64] (later renamed AMD64) architecture, and the Athlon II.

The Athlon made its debut on 23 June 1999. Athlon comes from the Greek athlos meaning "contest".
===

AMD Duron
The AMD Duron is a [x86-compatible] microprocessor that was manufactured by [AMD]. It was released on 19 June 2000 as a low-cost alternative to AMD's own [Athlon] processor and the [Pentium III] and [Celeron] processor lines from rival [Intel]. The Duron was discontinued in 2004 and succeeded by the [Sempron].
===

AMD Sempron
Sempron has been the marketing name used by [AMD] for several different budget desktop CPUs, using several different technologies and CPU socket formats. The Sempron replaced the [AMD Duron] processor and competes against [Intel]'s [Celeron] series of processors. AMD coined the name from the Latin semper, which means "always", to suggest the Sempron is suitable for "daily use, practical, and part of everyday life".
===

AMD Athlon 64
The Athlon 64 is an eighth generation, [AMD64] architecture microprocessor produced by [AMD], released on 23 September 2003. It is the third processor to bear the name Athlon, and the immediate successor to the Athlon XP. The second processor (after the [Opteron]) to implement AMD64 architecture and the first 64-bit processor targeted at the average consumer, it was AMD's primary consumer microprocessor, and competes primarily with [Intel]'s [Pentium 4], especially the "Prescott" and "Cedar Mill" core revisions. It is AMD's first K8, eighth generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers. Despite being natively 64-bit, the AMD64 architecture is backward-compatible with 32-bit x86 instructions. Athlon 64s have been produced for Socket 754, Socket 939, Socket 940 and Socket AM2. The line was succeeded by the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon X2 lines.
===

AMD Opteron
Opteron is [AMD]'s [x86] server and workstation processor line, and was the first processor which supported the [AMD64] instruction set architecture (known generically as [x86-64]). It was released on 22 April 2003 with the SledgeHammer core (K8) and was intended to compete in the server and workstation markets, particularly in the same segment as the [Intel Xeon] processor. Processors based on the AMD K10 microarchitecture (codenamed Barcelona) were announced on 10 September 2007 featuring a new quad-core configuration. The most recently released Opteron CPUs are the Piledriver based Opteron 4300 and 6300 series processors, codenamed "Seoul" and "Abu Dhabi" respectively.
===

AMD Phenom
Phenom is the 64-bit [AMD] desktop processor line based on the K10 microarchitecture, in what AMD calls family 10h (10 hex, i.e. 16 in normal decimal numbers) processors, sometimes incorrectly called "K10h". Triple-core versions (codenamed Toliman) belong to the Phenom 8000 series and quad cores (codenamed Agena) to the AMD Phenom X4 9000 series. The first processor in the family was released in 2007.
