POSIX
POSIX an acronym for Portable Operating System Interface, is a family of standards specified by the [IEEE Computer Society] for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of [Unix] and other operating systems.

Yum - Yellowdog Updater, Modified
The Yellowdog Updater, Modified (yum) is an open-source command-line package-management utility for [Linux] operating systems using the [RPM] Package Manager. Though yum has a command-line interface, several other tools provide graphical user interfaces to yum functionality.

Yum allows automatic updates, package and dependency management, on RPM-based distributions. Like the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) from [Debian], yum works with software repositories (collections of packages), which can be accessed locally or over a network connection.

Under the hood, yum depends on RPM, which is a packaging standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digisigs to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither yum nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by endusers. Yum is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as Yum Extender (yumex) also exist. A rewrite of yum based on libsolv named DNF is currently being developed and expected to replace yum as the default package manager in Fedora 22.

RPM Package Manager 
RPM Package Manager (RPM) (originally Red Hat Package Manager; now a recursive initialism) is a package management system. The name RPM variously refers to the .rpm file format, files in this format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager itself. RPM was intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base.

Even though it was created for use in Red Hat Linux, RPM is now used in many GNU/Linux distributions. It has also been ported to some other operating systems, such as Novell NetWare (as of version 6.5 SP3) and IBM's AIX (as of version 4).

Hello, World!
A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs "Hello, World!" (or some variant thereof) on a display device. Because it is typically one of the simplest programs possible in most programming languages, it is by tradition often used to illustrate to beginners the most basic syntax of a programming language. It is also used to verify that a language or system is operating correctly.
===

Software Metric
A software metric is a quantitative measure of a degree to which a software system or process possesses some property. Since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences, there is a continuous effort by computer science practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development. The goal is obtaining objective, reproducible and quantifiable measurements, which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning, cost estimation, quality assurance testing, software debugging, software performance optimisation, and optimal personnel task assignments.

Sinclair ZX80
The Sinclair ZX80 is a home computer brought to market in 1980 by Science of Cambridge Ltd. (later to be better known as [Sinclair Research]). It is notable for being the first computer (unless one counts the MK14) available in the United Kingdom for less than a hundred pounds. It was available in kit form for 79.95GBP, where purchasers had to assemble and solder it together, and as a ready built version at 99.95GBP. The ZX80 was very popular straight away, and for some time there was a waiting list of several months for either version of the machine.

The ZX80 was named after the [Z80] processor with the 'X' for "the mystery ingredient".
===

Sinclair ZX81
The ZX81 is a home computer produced by [Sinclair Research] and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's [ZX80] and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was eventually discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market – the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in a number of countries.

The ZX81 was designed to be small, simple, and above all cheap, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down. Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data were loaded and saved onto audio tape cassettes. It had only four silicon chips on board and a mere 1K of memory. The machine had no power switch or any moving parts (with the exception of a channel selector switch present only on early "ZX81 USA" models which pre-dated the Timex-Sinclair 1000) and used a pressure-sensitive membrane keyboard for manual input. The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible. Its distinctive design brought its designer, Rick Dickinson, a Design Council award.

The ZX81 could be bought by mail order in kit form or pre-assembled. In what was then a major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home computer that could be bought from high street stores, led by W.H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on to play a major role in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir [Clive Sinclair].
===

Sinclair ZX Spectrum 
The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by [Sinclair Research Ltd].

Referred to during development as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82, the machine was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair to highlight the machine's colour display, compared with the black and white of its predecessor, the [ZX81]. The Spectrum was ultimately released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level model with 16KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987; together they sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide (not counting numerous clones).

The Spectrum was among the first mainstream audience home computers in the UK, similar in significance to the [Commodore 64] in the USA. The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine, the effects of which are still seen; some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry. Licensing deals and clones followed, and earned [Clive Sinclair] a knighthood for "services to British industry".

The Commodore 64, Oric-1 and [Atmos], [BBC Microcomputer] and later the [Amstrad CPC] range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s. Over 24,000 software titles have been released since the Spectrum's launch and new titles continue to be released over 100 in 2012.

Sir Clive Marles Sinclair 
Sir Clive Marles Sinclair (born 30 July 1940) is an English entrepreneur and inventor, most commonly known for his work in consumer electronics in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

After spending several years as assistant editor of Practical Wireless and Instrument Practice, Sinclair founded Sinclair Radionics in 1961, where he produced the first slim-line electronic pocket calculator in 1972 (the Sinclair Executive). Sinclair later moved into the production of home computers and produced the [Sinclair ZX80], the UK's first mass-market home computer for less than 100GBP, and later, with [Sinclair Research], the [ZX81] and [ZX Spectrum]; the latter is widely recognised for its importance in the early days of the British home computer industry.

Knighted in 1983, Sinclair formed Sinclair Vehicles and released the Sinclair C5, a battery electric vehicle that was a commercial failure. Since then Sinclair has concentrated on personal transport, including the A-bike, a folding bicycle for commuters that weighs 5.5 kilograms (12lb) and folds down small enough to be carried on public transport.
===

Sinclair Research Ltd 
Sinclair Research Ltd is a British consumer electronics company founded by Sir [Clive Sinclair] in Cambridge. Originally incorporated in 1973 as Ablesdeal Ltd. and renamed to Westminster Mail Order Ltd and then Sinclair Instrument Ltd. in 1975, it remained dormant until 1976, when it was activated with the intention of continuing Sinclair's commercial work from his earlier company Sinclair Radionics; it adopted the name Sinclair Research in 1981.

In 1980, Clive Sinclair entered the home computer market with the [ZX80] at 99.95GBP, at the time the cheapest personal computer for sale in the UK. In 1982 the [ZX Spectrum] was released, later becoming the United Kingdom's best selling computer, competing aggressively against [Commodore] and [Amstrad].

At the height of its success, and largely inspired by the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer program, the company established the "MetaLab" research center at Milton Hall (near Cambridge), in order to pursue artificial intelligence, wafer-scale integration, formal verification and other advanced projects. The combination of the failures of the [Sinclair QL] computer and the TV80 led to financial difficulties in 1985, and a year later Sinclair sold the rights to their computer products and brand name to [Amstrad]. Sinclair Research Ltd still exists today as a one-man company, continuing to market Sir Clive Sinclair's newest inventions.

Commodore 64
The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by [Commodore International]. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units.

Volume production started in early 1982, with machines being released on to the market in August at a price of US$595. Preceded by the [Commodore VIC-20] and [Commodore PET], the C64 takes its name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM, and has technologically superior sound and graphical specifications when compared to some earlier systems such as the [Apple II] and [Atari 800], with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.

The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s. For a substantial period (1983-1986), the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year, outselling the [IBM PC compatibles], [Apple Inc] computers, and the [Atari] 8-bit family of computers. Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview, "When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years." In the UK market, the 64 faced competition from the [BBC Micro] and the [Sinclair Spectrum] but the 64 was still one of the two most-popular computers in the UK.

Part of the Commodore 64's success is because it was sold in retail stores instead of just electronics and / or computer stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs, including custom IC chips from [MOS Technology]. It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative mass-production.

Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and games. C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible video game console, to run these programs today. The C64 is also credited with popularising the computer demoscene and is still used today by some computer hobbyists. In 2008, 17 years after it was taken off the market, research showed that brand recognition for the model was still at 87%.
===

Commodore VIC-20
The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer which was sold by [Commodore Business Machines]. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the [PET]. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.

===

Commodore International
Commodore International was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI) along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM) participated in the development of the home personal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the [Commodore 64] (1982) and released its [Amiga] computer line in 1985.
===

Commodore Amiga
The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by [Commodore] in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model, the A1000, was launched in 1985 and became popular for its graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the [Commodore 64], and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The name "Amiga" was chosen because it is the Spanish word for (female) friend, and alphabetically it appears before [Apple] in lists of computer makers. It originated as a project code-named "Lorraine", therefore the female was used instead of the male and general version Amigo.

The best selling model, the Amiga 500, was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with approximately six million sold. The A3000, introduced in 1990, started the second generation of Amiga Systems, followed by the A500+ and the A600. Finally, as the third generation, the A1200 and the A4000 were released in 1992. However, poor marketing and failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the fourth generation game consoles, [Apple Macintosh], and [IBM PC compatibles].

Based on the [Motorola 68000] family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The original operating system, partly based on TRIPOS and written in [BCPL], is called AmigaDOS and the [GUI] is called Workbench. When it was eventually renamed AmigaOS, the BCPL parts were rewritten in the [C] language.
===

Commodore 128
The Commodore 128, also known as the C128 or occasionally CBM 128, is the last 8-bit home computer that was commercially released by [Commodore Business Machines] (CBM). Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas, it appeared three years after its predecessor, the bestselling [Commodore 64].

The C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64, with nearly full compatibility. The new machine has 128K of RAM in two 64K banks, and an 80-column color video output. It has a redesigned case and keyboard. Also included is a [Zilog Z80] CPU which allows the C128 to run [CP/M], as an alternative to the usual Commodore BASIC environment. The presence of the Z80 and the huge CP/M software library it brings, coupled with the C64's software library, gives the C128 one of the broadest ranges of available software among its competitors.

The primary hardware designer of the C128 was Bil Herd, who had worked on the Plus/4. Other hardware engineers were Dave Haynie and Frank Palaia, while the IC design work was done by Dave DiOrio. The main Commodore system software was developed by Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan, while the CP/M subsystem was developed by Von Ertwine.
===

Sinclair QL 
The Sinclair QL (for Quantum leap), is a personal computer launched by [Sinclair Research] in 1984, as an upper-end counterpart to the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum]. The QL was aimed at the serious home user and professional and executive users markets from small to large businesses and higher educational establishments, but failed to achieve commercial success.
===

Apple I
The original Apple Computer 1, also known retroactively as the Apple I, or Apple-1, was released by the Apple Computer Company (now [Apple Inc]) in 1976. They were designed and hand-built by [Steve Wozniak]. Wozniak's friend [Steve Jobs] had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only means of transportation, a VW Microbus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.
===

Apple II
The Apple II (styled as Apple ][) is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by [Steve Wozniak] ([Steve Jobs] oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by [Apple Computer]. It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until [Apple IIe] production ceased in November 1993.
===

Apple II Plus
The Apple II Plus (stylized as Apple ][+) is the second model of the Apple II series of personal computers produced by [Apple Computer] It was sold new from June 1979 to December 1982.
===

Apple IIe
The Apple IIe (styled as Apple //e, or sometimes Apple ][e) is the third model in the [Apple II] series of personal computers produced by [Apple Computer]. The e in the name stands for enhanced, referring to the fact that several popular features were now built-in that were only available as upgrades and add-ons in earlier models. It also improved upon expandability and added a few new features, which, all combined, made it very attractive to first-time computer shoppers as a general-purpose machine. The Apple IIe has the distinction of being the longest-lived computer in Apple's history, having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes.
===

Apple III 
The Apple III (often rendered as Apple ///) is a business oriented personal computer produced and released by [Apple Computer] that was intended as the successor to the [Apple II] series, but was largely considered a failure in the market. Development work on the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Dr. Wendell Sander. It had the internal code name of "Sara", named after Sander's daughter. The machine was first announced and released on 19 May 1980, but due to serious stability issues that required a design overhaul and a recall of existing machines, it was formally reintroduced in the second half of 1981. Development stopped and the Apple III was discontinued on 24 April 1984, and its last successor the [III Plus], was dropped from the Apple product line in September 1985.

The Apple III could be viewed as an enhanced Apple II - then the newest heir to a line of 8-bit machines dating back to 1976. However, the Apple III was not part of the Apple II line, but rather a close cousin. The key features business users wanted in a personal computer were a true typewriter-style upper/lowercase keyboard (as opposed to the Apple II which was based on a Teletype keyboard) and 80 column display. In addition, the machine had to pass U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) qualifications for business equipment. In 1981, International Business Machines unveiled the IBM Personal Computer ([IBM PC]) – a completely new 16-bit design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the [PC DOS] / [MS-DOS] platform, eventually pulling away from the Apple 8-bit computer line.

Despite numerous stability issues and a recall that included the first 14,000 units off the assembly line, Apple was eventually able to produce a reliable and dependable version of the machine. However, damage to the computer's reputation had already been done and it failed to do well commercially as a direct result. In the end, an estimated 65,000 - 75,000 Apple III computers were sold. The Apple III Plus brought this up to ~120,000. Apple co-founder [Steve Wozniak] stated that the primary reason for the Apple III's failure was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering driven projects. The Apple III's failure led to Apple reevaluating their plan to phase out the Apple II, and eventual continuation of development of the older machine. As a result, later Apple II models incorporated some hardware, such as the Apple Scribe Printer, a thermal printer, and software technologies of the Apple III.
===

Apple Lisa
The Lisa is a personal computer designed by [Apple Computer Inc] during the early 1980s. It was the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978. The Lisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.

In 1982, after [Steve Jobs] was forced out of the Lisa project, he joined the [Macintosh] project. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems. The final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.

The Lisa was a more advanced system than the Macintosh of this time in many respects, such as its inclusion of protected memory, cooperative multitasking, a generally more sophisticated hard disk based operating system, a built-in screensaver, an advanced calculator with a paper tape and RPN, support for up to 2 megabytes (MB) of RAM, expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection schemes such as block sparing, non-physical file names (with the ability to have multiple documents with the same name), and a larger higher-resolution display. It would be many years before many of those features were implemented on the Macintosh platform. Protected memory, for instance, didn't reappear until the [Mac OS X] operating system was released in 2001. The Macintosh featured a faster [68000] processor (7.89 MHz) and sound, however, while the complexity of the Lisa operating system and its programs taxed the 5 MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessor so that consumers said it felt sluggish, particularly when scrolling in documents.
===

Atari
The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by [Atari Inc] in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All are based on the [MOS Technology 6502] CPU running at 1.79 MHz, roughly twice that of similar designs, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the [Apple II] or [Commodore PET], and gaming on the platform was a major draw; Star Raiders is widely considered the platform's killer app. Machines with similar performance would not appear until the [BBC Micro] in late 1981 and the [Commodore 64] in 1982.

The original Atari 400 and 800 models were released with a series of plug-n-play peripherals that used Atari's unique "SIO" serial bus system. Over the following decade several versions of the same basic design were released, including the XL and XE series of computers and matching peripherals. All of these used the same basic logical design, with various changes to the physical layout to lower production costs as chipmaking and manufacturing processes improved over time. The early machines were expensive to build, but dependable. Later models like the XEs were greatly cost-reduced and generally not as robust.

The Atari 8-bit computer line sold two million units during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985, putting its sales on par with machines like the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum] and TI-99/4A. Its primary competition in the worldwide market was, starting in 1982, the [Commodore 64], which is by far the best selling computer of the 8-bit era. Atari also found a strong market in Eastern Europe and had something of a renaissance in the early 1990s as these countries joined a uniting Europe. Some estimates place sales during this period at another two million units.
===

Atari ST
The Atari ST is a line of home computers from [Atari Corporation], and the successor to the [Atari 8-bit family]. The first ST model, the 520ST, was released in June 1985. "ST" officially stands for "Sixteen/Thirty-two", which referred to the [Motorola 68000]'s 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's [GEM] released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration, and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than USD$1.

The Atari ST is part of the 16/32 bit generation of home computers, based on the Motorola 68000 CPU, typically with 512KB of RAM or more, a graphical user interface, and 3½" microfloppy disks as storage. It was similar to the [Apple Macintosh], and its simple design allowed the ST to precede the [Commodore Amiga]'s commercial release by almost two months. The ST was primarily a competitor to the [Macintosh], [Amiga], and in certain markets the [Acorn Archimedes]. Where the Amiga has a graphics accelerator and sample-based synthesis based sound, the ST has a simple frame buffer and a 3 voice synthesizer chip, but with a slightly faster CPU and a high-resolution monochrome display mode ideal for business and CAD. In some markets, particularly Germany, the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and Desktop publishing work.

Thanks to its built-in MIDI, the ST enjoyed success for running music-sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among both amateurs and well-known musicians.

The ST was later superseded by the Atari STE, Atari TT, Atari MEGA STE and Falcon computers.
===

Camputers Lynx
The Lynx was an 8-bit British home computer that was first released in early 1983 as a 48K model. Several models were available with 48K, 96K or 128K RAM. It was possible to reach 192K with RAM expansions on board. John Shireff designed the hardware and Davis Jansons the firmware.

The machine was based around a Z80A CPU clocked at 4 MHz, (6 MHz for the 128/192K models) and featured a Motorola 6845 as video controller. It was possible to run [CP/M] with the optional 5.25" floppy disk-drive on the 96K and 128K models.

The machine was quite advanced for its time. A 48K machine cost 225GBP, a 96K machine 299GBP and a 128K machine 345GBP. When compared to its competitors, such as the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum] and the Oric 1, it was also fairly highly priced. Camputers rebranded and relaunched each machine on several occasions, with the 48K machine renamed the Leisure, and the 128K machine renamed as the Laureate.

The machine had very little software available, and survived only until Camputers ceased trading in June 1984. It is believed that approximately 30,000 Camputers Lynx units were sold worldwide.

Anston Technology took over in November 1984 and a re-launch was planned but never happened. In June 1986, Anston sold everything - hardware, design rights and thousands of cassettes - to the National Lynx User Group. The group planned to produce a Super-Lynx but was too busy supplying spares and technical information to owners of existing models, and the project never came into being.

Unique features of this computer (compared to other home computers at the time) includes:

- A quite large BASIC, including graphics commands, in line CODE sentence for inclusion of machine code in hex. All numbers were floating point BCD numbers (even line numbers).
- A monitor program allowed hex dumps, copy, compare etc.
- The computer always ran in "high" resolution graphics mode (256x252 pixels in eight colours) using 6 times 10 pixels characters. Only a few bytes of graphic memory could be manipulated during the horizontal sync period[citation needed], and thus graphics were extremely slow compared to most other computers.
- Up to 192 kB of RAM and 20 kB of ROM (16 kB on the smallest model) on a 16 bit address bus was implemented using special hardware. As a consequence, certain RAM areas shadowed by ROM could only be used for data storage and the video memory had a green and alternative green bank that could be switched by a hardware register.
- For sound it had a simple (4 bit) DAC. A comparator was included to serve as an ADC (primarily used for reading from tape drives).

Compared to, for example, the [Commodore 64], the [BASIC] was more extensive and faster and resolution of graphics was better; but computer games on the other hand suffered from the special implementation and lack of hardware for sound and sprites. Thus, it was better for exploring programming or working with maths.

Dragon 32 / 64
The Dragon 32 and Dragon 64 are home computers that were built in the 1980s. The Dragons are very similar to the TRS-80 Color Computer, and were produced for the European market by Dragon Data, Ltd., in Port Talbot, Wales, and for the US market by Tano of New Orleans, Louisiana. The model numbers reflect the primary difference between the two machines, which have 32 and 64 kilobytes of RAM, respectively.

IBM PCjr 
The IBM PCjr (read "PC junior") was [IBM]'s first attempt to enter the home computer market. The PCjr, IBM model number 4860, retains the [IBM PC]'s [8088] CPU and BIOS interface for compatibility, but various design and implementation decisions led the PCjr to be a commercial failure.

Announced 1 November 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984, the PCjr nicknamed "Peanut" before its debut came in two models: the 4860-004, with 64KB of memory, priced at US$669 and the 4860-067, with 128KB of memory and a 360KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1269. It was manufactured for IBM in Lewisburg, Tennessee by Teledyne. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the IBM PC, which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard PC speaker sound and color graphics of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.

The graphics are produced by the Video Gate Array ([VGA]), an upward-compatible extension of Color Graphics Adapter ([CGA]) which adds three new graphics modes to CGA's seven. The PCjr's sound is provided by a Texas Instruments SN76489 which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a shift register. The PCjr is also the first PC compatible machine that supports page flipping for graphics operation. Since the PCjr uses system RAM to store video content and the location of this storage area can be changed, the PCjr can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are either difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.

The PCjr's 4.77 MHz [Intel 8088] CPU is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time, though the PCjr does not run at the full rated 4.77 MHz because every 4th clock cycle of the 8088 CPU is designated to refresh the PCjr's dynamic RAM as it has no dedicated memory controller; the computer's effective clockspeed is therefore 3.58 MHz. The detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's couch with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.

Ferranti
Ferranti was a UK electrical engineering and equipment firm that operated for over a century from 1885 until it went bankrupt in 1993 (the Belgian subsidiary lives on as Ferranti Computer Systems and is now part of the Nijkerk Holding). Known primarily for defence electronics, the company was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

The firm was known for work in the area of power grid systems and defence electronics. In addition, in 1951 Ferranti began selling the first commercially available computer, the [Ferranti Mark 1].
