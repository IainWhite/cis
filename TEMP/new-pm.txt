ReGIS - Remote Graphic Instruction Set
ReGIS, short for Remote Graphic Instruction Set, was a vector graphics markup language developed by Digital Equipment Corporation ([DEC]) for later models of their famous VT series of computer terminals. ReGIS supported rudimentary vector graphics consisting of lines, circular arcs, and similar shapes. Terminals supporting ReGIS generally allowed graphics and text to be mixed on-screen, which made construction of graphs and charts relatively easy.

ReGIS was first introduced on the [VT125] in July 1981, followed shortly thereafter by the VK100 "GIGI" which combined the VT125 display system with composite video output and a [BASIC] interpreter. Later versions of the VT series included ReGIS, often with color support as well. This included the [VT240] and 241, VT330 and 340, and the VT525. ReGIS is also supported by a small number of terminal emulator systems.

ReGIS replaced an earlier system known as waveform graphics that had been introduced on the VT55 and later used on the VT105. DEC normally provided backward compatibility with their terminals, but in this case the waveform system was simply dropped when ReGIS was introduced.

VT220
The VT220 was an [ANSI standard] computer terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation ([DEC]) in 1983. The VT240 added monochrome [ReGIS] vector graphics support to the base model, while the VT241 did the same in color. The 200 series replaced the successful [VT100] series, providing more functionality in a much smaller unit with a much smaller and lighter keyboard. Among its major upgrades was a number of international characters, as well as the ability to define new character sets.

The VT200 series was extremely successful in the market. Released at $795, the VT220 offered features, packaging and price that no other serial terminal could touch. In 1986, DEC shipped 165,000 units, giving them a 42% market share, double that of the closest competitor, [Wyse]. Competitors adapted by introducing similar models at lower price points, leading DEC to do the same by releasing the less expensive $545 [VT300] series in 1987. By that time, DEC had shipped over one million VT220s.

The VT220 improved on the earlier VT100 series of terminals with a redesigned keyboard, much smaller physical packaging, and a much faster microprocessor. The VT220 was available with [CRT]s that used white, green, or amber phosphors.

The VT100s, like the [VT50s] before them, had been packaged in relatively large cases that provided room for expansion systems. The VT200s abandoned this concept, and wrapped the much smaller 1980s era electronics tightly around the CRT. The result was a truncated pyramidal case with the apex at the back, only slightly larger than the CRT. This made it much easier to fit the terminal on a desk. An adjustable stand allowed the angle of the CRT to be adjusted up and down. Because it was lower than head height, the result was an especially ergonomic terminal.

The LK201 keyboard supplied with the VT220 was one of the first full-length, low-profile keyboards available; it was developed at DEC's Roxbury, Massachusetts facility. It was much smaller and lighter than the VT100s version, and connected to the terminal using a lighter and more flexible coiled cable and a telephone jack connector.

The VT200s were the last DEC terminals to provide a 20mA current loop serial interface, an older standard originally developed for the telegraph system. A standard 25-pin D-connector was also provided for [RS-232]. Only one of the two ports could be in use at a given time. Later DEC terminals would replace both of these with their proprietary Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) connectors.

The VT220 was designed to be compatible with the VT100, but added features to make it more suitable for an international market. This was accomplished by including a number of different character sets that could be selected among using a series of ANSI commands. The terminal shipped with a total of 288 characters in its ROM, each one formed from a 8 by 10 pixel glyph (the character grid was 10 by 10, DEC only used 8 by 10). The characters included the 96 printable ASCII characters, 67 Display Controls, 32 DEC Special Graphics, and an upside-down question mark, used to represent undefined characters.

The VT200s included the ability to make minor changes to the character set using the [National Replacement Character Set] (NRCS) concept. When operating on an [8-bit clean] link up to 256 character codes were available, which included a full set of European characters. But when operating on a typical 7-bit link, only 128 were available, and only 96 of these produced display output as the rest were control characters. This was not enough characters to handle all European languages. Most terminals solved this by shipping multiple complete character sets in ROM, but there was a cost in doing so.

DEC's solution to this problem, NCRS, allowed individual characters glyphs in the base set of 96 7-bit characters to be swapped out. For instance, the British set replaced the US's hash character, # for the pound sign, £. The terminal included 14 such replacement sets. This eliminated the need to ship 14 versions of the terminal, or to include 14 different 7-bit character sets in [ROM].

Additionally, the VT200s allowed for another 96 characters in the Dynamically Redefined Character Set (DRCS), which could be downloaded from the host computer. Data for the glyphs was sent by encoding a set of six vertical pixels into a single character code, and then sending many of these Sixels to the terminal, which decoded them into the character set memory. In later models, the same sixel concept would be used to send bitmapped graphics as well. Character graphics were a common example of these downloaded sets.

VT320
The VT320 was an [ANSI standard] computer terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation ([DEC]) in 1987. The VT320 was the text-only version, while the VT330 added monochrome [ReGIS], [Sixel] and [Tektronix 4010] graphics, and the VT340 added color. The VT320 was replaced by the [VT420] in 1990, but the VT340 remained in production until all of these models were replaced by the [VT500] series in 1994.

The 300 series replaced the earlier [VT200] series, as a lower-cost system better able to compete with a number of VT220 clones that had entered the market. Foremost among these was the Wyse WT-60, introduced in 1986 with a form factor and feature set similar to the VT220, but including 4010 graphics and selling for only $699, compared to $795 for the base model VT220 lacking graphics. The VT320 was introduced at $545, something of a surprise, forcing Wyse to lower their prices to $599.

The VT300s introduced a number of new features compared to the VT200s. With the great increase in [RAM] available, the 300's added the ability to store several pages of data locally, as well as perform editing on that data entirely within the terminal. The user could scroll up and down among several pages, normally about three, perform edits, and then send all of the changes to the host in a single operation. This required compatible host-side software to work. That memory also meant all of the 300 series were able to store large numbers of sixel-based glyphs, allowing them to be used not only as a user-defined character set as in the earlier 200's, but also to produce full-screen bitmap graphics by storing a separate sixel for each location on the screen.

Finally, all members of the line could support two sessions, either using two MMJ ports available on some models, or in the case of the VT330 and VT340, using a single serial connection using a system known as TD/SMP on the server and SSU on the terminals. The TD/SMP protocol was never published, and only worked with DEC's own terminal servers. Using either system, the terminal could display the two sessions "stacked" and switch between them, or by splitting the screen vertically to show them one above the other, or horizontally side-by-side. The serial ports could run up to 19,200 bps, up from 9,600 bps on the VT200s.

Like the VT200's, the VT300's included a number of alternate character sets for various international uses and basic form graphics. The system shipped with five sets of 94 characters, as well as a single set with 96 graphics characters. The sets were ASCII, ISO Latin and three graphics character sets. Using sixels, any one of these sets could be replaced with user-generated characters. The system also included DEC's unique [National Replacement Character Sets] that allowed single characters in a set to be swapped out to match the layout of a keyboard. For instance, in the UK the # symbol could be swapped out for the £, eliminating the need for custom versions of the terminal for each country. It supported the full range of ANSI escape codes, although some sources state it did not decode standard color sequences even on the VT340.

The screen itself was a 14 inch [CRT] mounted on a tilt and swivel stand. It offered a resolution of 800 by 500, and a number of different glyphs could be used to produce 25 lines or either 80 or 132 columns of text, the 25th line normally being used to display status codes, like caps lock, generated locally in the terminal. The VT330 had two bit-planes that produced 4 shades of grey, while the VT340 had four bit-planes to produce 16 colours out of a palette of 4096.

As was the case with all DEC terminals, the VT300 series could emulate previous models. The 300's could be set to [VT100] or [VT52] mode.
===

VT420
The VT420 was an [ANSI standard] computer terminal introduced in 1990 by Digital Equipment Corporation ([DEC]). The 420 was the only model in the 400 series, replacing the [VT320]. There were no colour or graphics capable 400 series terminals; the VT340 remained in production for those requiring [ReGIS] and [Sixel] graphics and colour support. The entire lineup of VT300s and VT420 was eventually replaced by the relatively unknown [VT500] series starting in 1993.

The VT420 consisted largely of a combination of the VT320 with the virtual terminal support of the VT330 and VT340. Those two models had included a system known as TD/SMP which allowed two sessions to be multiplexed over a single serial connection to a compatible terminal server. Alternately the two sessions could be supported by separate serial connections on those models with multiple MMJ ports. Using either method, the VT330/340/420 could either show the two sessions behind each other, using a key sequence to flip back and forth, or split the screen horizontally to display the sessions one above the other, or vertically side-by-side.

The VT420 also added a number of more minor features. One was to add a number of PC character sets, allowing the terminal to be used with a variety of PC programs. Another allowed the terminal to generate the proper character sequences to produce rectangular area commands. For instance, one could select a rectangular area and fill it with a particular character, or blank it out. This was in addition to the terminal side editing system introduced on the VT300s.

The VT420 had a total of 5 sets of 94 characters for normal VT operation, another 3 sets of 128 PC characters, and 1 set of 96 characters containing various graphics and math symbols. Like all models since the [VT200] series, the user could also upload a custom character set of their own design using the Sixel system. Likewise, it also supported the [National Replacement Character Set] system, which swapped out single characters in 7-bit modes to allow basic changes like swapping the # for the £ for use on UK systems.

All DEC terminals that came after the [VT100], including the VT420, are able to emulate their ancestors. The VT420 had VT100 and [VT52] emulating modes.

The screen itself was a 14" flat [CRT] with a resolution of 800 (horizontal) by 400 (vertical) pixels. A variety of glyphs were available that provided 80 or 132 characters across, and 24, 36 or 48 lines of text vertically. The screen had room for 25 lines at normal font sizes, but the last line was normally used for status indications, like ⇪ Caps Lock. The MMJ ports could operate at speeds up to 38,400 bit/s, double that of the VT300s maximum 19,200 bit/s.
===

VT520
The VT520 is an [ANSI standard] computer terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation ([DEC]) in 1993 and 1994. The VT520 supports monochrome graphics using the [ReGIS] vector or [Sixel] bitmap systems. The VT525 added colour support, while the VT510 was a single-session, text-only version with a built in monitor. The VT525 appears to be the most popular model in the series.

The VT500s replaced all previous models of DEC's VT line, at that time consisting of the [VT420] text and [VT340] graphics terminals. It was introduced in an era when the market was being flooded by low-cost I[BM PC clones] which could perform the same functions using a terminal emulator while also running other software. DEC introduced the VT500s only a short time before selling off their entire terminal division in August 1995. This brought the VT series to a close, after a total of about six million terminals had been sold.

The VT520 is still available from Boundless Technologies.

VT52
The VT50 was a [CRT] based computer terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation ([DEC]) in July 1974. It provided a display with 12 rows and 80 columns of upper-case text, and used an expanded set of control characters and forward only scrolling based on the earlier VT05. DEC documentation of the era refers to the terminals as the DECscope, a name that was otherwise almost never seen.

The VT50 was sold only for a short period before it was replaced by the VT52 in September 1975. The VT52 provided a screen of 24 rows and 80 columns of text and supported all 95 ASCII characters as well as 32 graphics characters, bi-directional scrolling, and an expanded control character system. DEC produced a series of upgraded VT52's with additional hardware for various uses.

The VT52 family was followed by the much more sophisticated [VT100] in 1978.

The VT50 supported asynchronous communication at baud rates up to 9600 bits per second and did not require any fill characters. Like other early DEC terminals, the VT50 series were equipped with both an [RS-232] port as well as a 20mA current loop, an older serial standard used with teletype machines that was more suitable to long distance transmission over phone lines. Data was read into a small buffer, which the display hardware periodically read to produce the display.

To interpret the commands being sent in the serial data, it used a primitive central processing unit ([CPU]) built from small-scale-integration integrated circuits. It examined the data while the display hardware was inactive between raster scan lines, and then triggered the display hardware to take over at the appropriate time. The display system returned control to the CPU when it was complete. The CPU was so basic that addition and subtraction could only be done by repeatedly incrementing or decrementing two registers. Moreover, the time taken by such a loop had to be nearly constant, or text lower on the screen would be displayed in the wrong place during that refresh.

Characters typed on the keyboard were likewise stored in a buffer and read back over the serial line as quickly as possible. One notable feature of the VT50 was the introduction of a separate function keypad with the "[Gold Key]", which was used for editing programs like [WPS-8], KED, and EDT. Pressing the Gold Key and then typing one of the keys on the keyboard sent a command sequence back to the host computer.

DEC also offered an optional hard-copy device called an electrolytic copier, which fit into the blank panel on the right side of the display. This device was able to print, scan-line by scan-line, an exact replica of the screen onto a damp roll of special paper. It did this by electroplating metal from an electrode into the paper. The paper ran between two electrodes. The electrode on one side was a thin straight bar oriented across the paper width. The electrode on the other side was a thin helical bar wrapped around a rotating drum. One rotation of the drum scanned an intersecting area of the electrodes across the width of the paper. While the copier did an admirable job of capturing the contents of the screen, the output of the copier had an unfortunate resemblance to wet toilet tissue. Digital patented the innovation of having a single character generator provide the text font for both screen and copier.

The basic layout of the terminal, with the screen and main keyboard on the left and the blank area on the right, was intended to allow the system to be upgraded. The printer was one such upgrade, but over time DEC offered a number of other options. The large size of the cabinet was deliberate, to avoid a cooling fan. The two circuit boards with processor and memory at the base of the terminal, and a single board with power-supply and monitor electronics at the rear, were cooled by convection. The large, flat top of the terminal frequently accommodated large volumes of DEC documentation, which could block the vents and cause overheating.

DEC WPS-8
WPS-8 was the name of a [Word Processing System] sold by [Digital Equipment Corporation] for use with their PDP-8 processors (including the VT78, VT278 [DECmate], and PC238 DECmate II and PC24P DECmate III microcomputer systems).

WPS-8 supported a variety of 24 row by 80 or 132 column terminals including the [VT52] family as well as the [VT100] family and all subsequent [ANSI-compatible] terminals. A series of hierarchical menus allowed the user to command the system; the particular style of these menus became very widely used by Digital, particularly within their "ALL-IN-1" office system. Once a document was opened for editing, near [WYSIWYG] editing was provided using a ruler to indicate the text alignment and tab stops for any given portion of the text. A typical editing session might have looked like this:

  Text conformed to the
  preceding ruler (now offscreen).
----L----T-----------------------------T---------------------------------------------R----
    Text conformed to the ruler shown just above
    L -> Left margin
    R -> Ragged-right margin
    T -> Left-aligned tab
---------L----------------------------->---------------------.-----------------------J----
         > -> Right-aligned tab
         . -> Decimal-aligned tab
         J -> Justified right margin (not justified on screen, only on printout)

              Aligned with the right tab
              Decimal-point aligned                        $5.99
                                                         1279.99

Using these various rulers, complex formatting could be achieved, even using a simple input device like a 24x80 character terminal. On ANSI terminals, character attributes such as bold and underline were shown on the screen. On the VT52 terminals (which could not display attributes), the operator could perform the same functions but only the printout would reveal the formatting.

As text was typed-in, the system automatically word-wrapped the text so that it conformed to the ruler currently in effect for that section of the document. Rulers could be added or modified and the text from that ruler forward to the next would automatically be adjusted to conform to the new ruler. Hyphenation could be semi-automatically performed (including "hidden" hyphens that would only be revealed if a line break exposed them).

Specialised editing functions were provided using the terminal keypad. A few functions could be commanded simply by pressing a keypad key, but a far wider range of functions could be commanded by prefixing them with the "[Gold Key]" (the PF1 key on the keypad, coloured gold on systems equipped with the WPS-8 custom keycaps). This style of "gold key" editing also became endemic at Digital, later showing up in mainstream general purpose text editors such as KED and EDT as well as the before mentioned "ALL-IN-1" office system. The editing facilities included making a selection and then using cut and paste (much like today's word processors, but using keys marked for cut and paste, rather than a mouse).

Printing was to any of several different letter quality daisy wheel printers including a DEC variant of the Diablo 630.

WPS-8 normally ran from a single floppy diskette and user data could be stored on the system diskette or additional data only diskettes. Up to four diskette drives were supported in a single system.

The system also supported the creation of data tables, the sorting of these data tables, arithmetic calculations using these data, and a mail merge operation using these data and the arithmetic results. Through the extensive use of overlays, it managed all that on a 12-bit, 1.2-μs processor with 16 KWords of memory and 256KB of diskette storage. The limited resources of the system did not permit a spell-checker, though, primarily because there was no place with adequate storage to contain the dictionary file.

DEC ALL-IN-1
ALL-IN-1 was an office automation product developed and sold by [Digital Equipment Corporation] in the 1980s. [HP] now maintains the current version Office Server V3.2 for [OpenVMS Alpha] and [OpenVMS VAX] systems.

ALL-IN-1 was advertised as an office automation system including functionality in Electronic Messaging, Word Processing and Time Management. It offered an application development platform and customisation capabilities that ranged from scripting to code-level integration.

ALL-IN-1 was designed and developed by Skip Walter, John Churin and Marty Skinner from Digital Equipment Corporation who began work in 1977. The first version of the software was called CP/OSS, the Charlotte Package of Office System Services, named after the location of the developers. In 1983, the product was renamed ALL-IN-1 and the Charlotte group continued to develop versions 1.1 through 1.3.

Digital then made the decision to move most of the development activity to its central engineering facility in Reading, United Kingdom, where a group there took responsibility for the product from version 2.0 (released in field test in 1984 and to customers in 1985) onward. The Charlotte group continued to work on the Time Management subsystem until version 2.3 and other contributions were made from groups based in Sophia-Antipolis, France (System for Customisation Management and the integration with VAX Notes), Reading (Message Router and MAILbus), and Spitbrook, New Hampshire (FMS). ALL-IN-1 V3.0 introduced shared file cabinets and the File Cabinet Server (FCS) to lay the foundation for an eventual integration with TeamLinks, Digital's PC office client. Previous integrations with PCs included PC ALL-IN-1, a [DOS] based product introduced in 1989 that never proved popular with customers.
===

The Gold Key
The Gold key is a computer keyboard key used as a prefix to invoke a variety of single-key editing and formatting functions. Usually located in the top-left position of the numeric keypad on platforms such as the [VT100], it is the signature element of a consistent user interface implemented by [Digital Equipment Corporation] across multiple product lines.

It is used within WPS, EDT, and many other common [VAX] programs. The key, typically located as the upper leftmost key on the numeric keypad on different terminals, was not necessarily coloured gold. Some Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) terminals would include keyboards where the gold key was labeled PF1, as on the VT100 and [VT200], or was coloured blue, as on the [VT52]. On some keyboards, the normal function of a key would be labeled on the lower portion of the key, while its alternate function activated with the GOLD key would be labeled above it.

The Gold Key is used to invoke single-key functions which may be located on either the main keyboard or the numeric keypad. For example, on the [WPS-8] word processing system, the main keyboard key C is marked “CENTR”, in gold lettering, on its front surface; the keystrokes GOLDC invoke that word processing function to center the current line of text.

The Gold key is a prefix key, not a modifier key. A modifier key would be pressed and held while a second key is pressed; the Gold key is pressed and released before a second key is pressed and released. In that sense, DEC and compatible software uses the Gold key in the same way that [Emacs] uses the escape key.

Tektronix 401x
The Tektronix 401x series was a family of text and graphics computer terminals based on the company's storage tube technology. The 4000 series were less expensive (under $10,000) than earlier graphics terminals, such as the IBM 2250 because no additional electronics were needed to maintain the display on the screen (beyond providing proper voltages to it). They were widely used in the [CAD] market in the 1970s and early 1980s. There were several members of the family introduced through the 1970s, the best known being the 4010 and 4014. They remained popular until the introduction of inexpensive graphics workstations in the 1980s. The new graphics workstations used raster displays and dedicated screen buffers that became more affordable as solid state memory chips became cheaper.
===

Tektronix
Tektronix Inc is an American company best known for manufacturing test and measurement devices such as oscilloscopes, logic analysers, and video and mobile test protocol equipment. In November 2007, Danaher Corporation acquired Tektronix as a subsidiary. The company received a 2007 Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for compliance standards monitoring systems for Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standard and Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) transport streams. Several charities are or were associated with Tektronix, including the Tektronix Foundation and the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust in Vancouver, Washington.

WebDAV - Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([HTTP]) that allows clients to perform remote Web content authoring operations. A working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force ([IETF]) defined WebDAV in [RFC 4918].

The WebDAV protocol provides a framework for users to create, change and move documents on a server, typically a web server or web share. The most important features of the WebDAV protocol include the maintenance of properties about an author or modification date, namespace management, collections, and overwrite protection. Maintenance of properties includes such things as the creation, removal, and querying of file information. Namespace management deals with the ability to copy and move web pages within a server’s namespace. Collections deal with the creation, removal, and listing of various resources. Lastly, overwrite protection handles aspects related to locking of files.

The WebDAV working group concluded its work in March 2007, after the Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG]) accepted an incremental update to [RFC 2518]. Other extensions left unfinished at that time, such as the BIND method, have been finished by their individual authors, independent of the formal working group.

SabreDAV 
SabreDAV is an open source [WebDAV] server, developed by fruux built in [PHP]. It is an implementation of the WebDAV protocol (with extensions for [CalDAV] and CardDAV), providing a native PHP server implementation which operates on [Apache 2] and [Nginx] web servers.
===

CalDAV - Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV
Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV, or CalDAV, is an Internet standard allowing a client to access scheduling information on a remote server. It extends [WebDAV] ([HTTP] based protocol for data manipulation) specification and uses [iCalendar] format for the data. The access protocol is defined by [RFC 4791]. It allows multiple client access to the same information thus allowing cooperative planning and information sharing. Many server and client applications support the protocol. Extensions to CalDAV for automated scheduling are also standardised, as [RFC 6638].
===

iCalendar
iCalendar is a computer file format which allows Internet users to send meeting requests and tasks to other Internet users, via email, or sharing files with an extension of .ics. Recipients of the iCalendar data file (with supporting software, such as an email client or calendar application) can respond to the sender easily or counter propose another meeting date / time.

iCalendar is used and supported by a large number of products, including [Google Calendar], Apple Calendar (formerly [iCal]), [IBM Lotus Notes], [Yahoo! Calendar], Evolution (software), eM Client, Lightning extension for [Mozilla Thunderbird] and [SeaMonkey], and partially by [Microsoft Outlook] and [Novell GroupWise].

iCalendar is designed to be independent of the transport protocol. For example, certain events can be sent by traditional email or whole calendar files can be shared and edited by using a WebDav server, or [SyncML]. Simple web servers (using just the HTTP protocol) are often used to distribute iCalendar data about an event and to publish busy times of an individual. Publishers can embed iCalendar data in web pages using [hCalendar], a 1:1 microformat representation of iCalendar in semantic (X)HTML.
===

hCalendar
hCalendar (short for HTML iCalendar) is a microformat standard for displaying a semantic (X)HTML representation of [iCalendar] format calendar information about an event, on web pages, using HTML classes and rel attributes.

It allows parsing tools (for example other websites, or browser add-ons like [Firefox]'s Operator extension) to extract the details of the event, and display them using some other website, index or search them, or to load them into a calendar or diary program, for instance. Multiple instances can be displayed as timelines.

SyncML (Synchronization Markup Language) 
SyncML (Synchronization Markup Language) is the former name for a platform independent information synchronisation standard. The project is currently referred to as Open Mobile Alliance Data Synchronisation and Device Management. The purpose of SyncML is to offer an open standard as a replacement for existing data synchronisation solutions, which have mostly been somewhat vendor, application or operating system specific.

Novell GroupWise
GroupWise is a messaging and collaboration platform from [Novell] that supports email, calendaring, personal information management, instant messaging, and document management. The GroupWise platform consists of desktop client software, which is available for [Windows], [Mac OS X], and [Linux], and the server software, which is supported on Windows Server and Linux.

The platform also supports WebAccess, its browser-based webmail client. Mobile access to messaging, calendaring, contacts and other data from smartphones and tablet computers is supported (through the Novell Data Synchroniser server software) via the Exchange ActiveSync protocol. Enterprise instant messaging and presence is handled by Novell Messenger, which integrates with GroupWise.

Base64
Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an [ASCII] string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The term Base64 originates from a specific [MIME] content transfer encoding.

Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that is designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during transport. Base64 is commonly used in a number of applications, including email via MIME, and storing complex data in [XML].

WebGL
WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a [JavaScript] API for rendering interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL is integrated completely into all the web standards of the browser allowing GPU accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas.

Google Panda
Google Panda is a change to [Google]'s search results ranking algorithm that was first released in February 2011. The change aimed to lower the rank of "low-quality sites" or "thin sites", and return higher quality sites near the top of the search results. CNET reported a surge in the rankings of news websites and social networking sites, and a drop in rankings for sites containing large amounts of advertising. This change reportedly affected the rankings of almost 12 percent of all search results. Soon after the Panda rollout, many websites, including Google's webmaster forum, became filled with complaints of scrapers / copyright infringers getting better rankings than sites with original content. At one point, Google publicly asked for data points to help detect scrapers better. Google's Panda has received several updates since the original rollout in February 2011, and the effect went global in April 2011. To help affected publishers, Google provided an advisory on its blog, thus giving some direction for self-evaluation of a website's quality. Google has provided a list of 23 bullet points on its blog answering the question of "What counts as a high-quality site?" that is supposed to help webmasters "step into Google's mindset".

Google Panda is a filter that prevents low quality sites and / or pages from ranking well in the search engine results page. The filter's threshold is influenced by Google Quality Raters. Quality Raters answer questions such as "would I trust this site with my credit card?" so that Google can distinguish the difference between high and low quality sites.

The Google Panda patent (patent 8,682,892), filed on 28 September 2012, was granted on 25 March 2014. The patent states that Google Panda creates a ratio with a site's inbound links and reference queries, search queries for the site's brand. That ratio is then used to create a sitewide modification factor. The sitewide modification factor is then used to create a modification factor for a page based upon a search query. If the page fails to meet a certain threshold, the modification factor is applied and, therefore, the page would rank lower in the search engine results page.

Google Panda affects the ranking of an entire site or a specific section rather than just the individual pages on a site.

In March 2012, Google updated Panda.

Google says it only takes a few pages of poor quality or duplicated content to hold down traffic on an otherwise solid site, and recommends such pages be removed, blocked from being indexed by the search engine, or rewritten. However, Matt Cutts, head of webspam at Google, warns that rewriting duplicate content so that it is original may not be enough to recover from Panda, the rewrites must be of sufficiently high quality, as such content brings "additional value" to the web. Content that is general, non-specific, and not substantially different from what is already out there should not be expected to rank well: "Those other sites are not bringing additional value. While they’re not duplicates they bring nothing new to the table."

Google Penalty 
A Google penalty is the negative impact on a website's search rankings based on updates to [Google]'s search algorithms and / or manual review. The penalty can be an unfortunate by-product of an algorithm update or an intentional penalisation for various black-hat SEO techniques.

Google penalises sites for engaging in practices that are against its webmaster guidelines. These penalties can be the result of a manual review or algorithm updates such as [Google Penguin].

Google penalties can result in the drop of rankings for every page of a site, for a specific keyword, or for a specific page. Any drop in rankings brings with it a major drop in traffic for the site.

To find out if a website has been affected by a Google penalty, website owners can use Google Webmaster Tools as well as analyse the timing of their traffic drop with the timing of known Google updates.

Google has been updating its algorithm for as long as it has been fighting the manipulation of organic search results. However, up until May 10, 2012, when Google launched the Google Penguin update, many people wrongly believed that low-quality backlinks would not negatively affect ranks. While this viewpoint was common, it was not correct, as Google had been applying such link-based penalties for many years, but not made public how the company approached and dealt with what they called "link spam". Since this time there has been a much wider acknowledgement about the dangers of bad [SEO] and a forensic analysis of backlinks to ensure there are no harmful links.

Google Penguin
Google Penguin is a codename for a [Google] algorithm update that was first announced on 24 April 2012. The update is aimed at decreasing search engine rankings of websites that violate Google’s Webmaster Guidelines by using now declared black-hat SEO techniques involved in increasing artificially the ranking of a webpage by manipulating the number of links pointing to the page. Such tactics are commonly described as link schemes. According to Google's John Mueller, Google has announced all updates to the Penguin filter to the public.

By Google’s estimates, Penguin affects approximately 3.1% of search queries in English, about 3% of queries in languages like German, Chinese, and Arabic, and an even bigger percentage of them in "highly spammed" languages. On 25 May 2012, Google unveiled another Penguin update, called Penguin 1.1. This update, according to Matt Cutts, was supposed to affect less than one-tenth of a percent of English searches. The guiding principle for the update was to penalise websites using manipulative techniques to achieve high rankings. The purpose per Google was to catch excessive spammers. Allegedly, few websites lost search rankings on Google for specific keywords during the Panda and Penguin rollouts. Google specifically mentions that doorway pages, which are only built to attract search engine traffic, are against their webmaster guidelines.

In January 2012, the so-called Page Layout Algorithm Update (also known as the Top Heavy Update) was released, which targeted websites with too many ads, or too little content above the fold.

Penguin 3 was released 5 October 2012 and affected 0.3% of queries. Penguin 4 (AKA Penguin 2.0) was released on 22 May 2013 and affected 2.3% of queries. Penguin 5 (AKA Penguin 2.1) was released on 4 October 2013, affected around 1% of queries, and has been the most recent of the Google Penguin algorithm updates.

Spamdexing
In computing, spamdexing (also known as search engine spam, search engine poisoning, Black-Hat SEO, search spam or web spam) is the deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes. It involves a number of methods, such as repeating unrelated phrases, to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of the indexing system. It could be considered to be a part of [search engine optimisation], though there are many search engine optimisation methods that improve the quality and appearance of the content of web sites and serve content useful to many users. Search engines use a variety of algorithms to determine relevancy ranking. Some of these include determining whether the search term appears in the body text or URL of a web page. Many search engines check for instances of spamdexing and will remove suspect pages from their indexes. Also, people working for a search-engine organisation can quickly block the results listing from entire websites that use spamdexing, perhaps alerted by user complaints of false matches. The rise of spamdexing in the mid 1990s made the leading search engines of the time less useful. Using unethical methods to make websites rank higher in search engine results than they otherwise would is commonly referred to in the SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) industry as "Black Hat SEO."

Common spamdexing techniques can be classified into two broad classes: content spam (or term spam) and link spam.

Google Hummingbird
Google Hummingbird is a search algorithm used by [Google].

Google started using Hummingbird about 30 August 2013, and announced the change on 26 September on the eve of the company's 15th anniversary.

Gianluca Fiorelli said Hummingbird is about synonyms but also about context. Google always had synonyms, he writes, but with Hummingbird it is also able to judge context - thereby judging the intent of a person carrying out a search, to determine what they are trying to find out. This concept is called semantic search.

Danny Sullivan said of Hummingbird, "Google said that Hummingbird is paying more attention to each word in a query, ensuring that the whole query — the whole sentence or conversation or meaning — is taken into account." Michelle Hill said Hummingbird is about "understanding intent". Steve Masters wrote, "The Hummingbird approach should be inspirational to anyone managing and planning content — if you aren't already thinking like Hummingbird, you should be. In a nutshell, think about why people are looking for something rather than what they are looking for. A content strategy should be designed to answer their needs, not just provide them with facts".

The Hummingbird update was the first major update to Google's search algorithm since the 2010 “Caffeine Update”, but even that was limited primarily to improving the indexing of information rather than the sorting of information. Google search chief Amit Singhal stated that Hummingbird is the first major update of its type since 2001.

Conversational search leverages natural language, semantic search, and more to improve the way search queries are parsed. Unlike previous search algorithms which would focus on each individual word in the search query, Hummingbird considers each word but also how each word makes up the entirety of the query — the whole sentence or conversation or meaning — is taken into account, rather than particular words. The goal is that pages matching the meaning do better, rather than pages matching just a few words.

Much like an extension of Google's "Knowledge Graph", Hummingbird is aimed at making interactions more human — capable of understanding the concepts and relationships between keywords.

Hummingbird places greater emphasis on page content making search results more relevant and pertinent and ensuring that Google delivers users to the most appropriate page of a website, rather than to a home page or top level page.

Sixel
Sixel, short for "six pixels", is a bitmap graphics format supported by terminals and printers from [DEC]. It consists of a pattern six pixels high and one wide, resulting in 63 possible patterns. Each possible pattern is assigned an [ASCII] character, making the sixels easy to transmit on 7-bit serial links.

Sixel was first introduced as a way of sending bitmap graphics to DEC dot matrix printers like the LA50. After being put into "sixel mode" the following data was interpreted to directly control six of the pins in the nine pin print head. A string of sixel characters encodes a single 6 pixel high row of the image.

The system was later re-used as a way to send bitmap data to the [VT200] series terminals as a way to define custom character sets. A number of sixels were used to define each character. Starting with the [VT300] series, the terminals could decode a complete sixel image to the screen, like those previously sent to printers.

Sixel encodes images by breaking up the bitmap into a series of 6 pixel high horizontal strips. Each 1 pixel wide vertical column in a particular strip forms a single sixel. Each sixel's pixels are read as binary and encoded into a single 6 bit number, with "on" pixels encoded as a 1. This number, from 0 to 63 decimal, is then converted into a single ASCII character, offset by 63 so that an all-black sixel, 0 decimal, is encoded as ?. This ensures that the sixels remain within the easily printable range of the character set. Carriage return (CR) is represented by $, and line feeds (LF) with a -, both had to be sent in turn to return the cursor to the start of the line, CRLF.

Sixel also included a rudimentary form of compression, using Run Length Encoding ([RLE]). This was accomplished with the ! character followed by a decimal number of the times to repeat, and then a single sixel character to be repeated. Since the ! and decimal digits could not be valid sixel data, lying outside the encoded range, the encoding was easy to identify and expand back out in software.

"Sixel mode" was entered by sending the sequence <ESC>Pp1;p2;p3;q. The p1 through p3 were optional setup parameters, with p1 defining an aspect ratio (deprecated in favor of p3), p2 how to interpret the color of zeros, and p3 with simple grid size parameters. <ESC>P is the standard DEC "Device Control String", or DCS, which was used to turn on or off a number of special features in DEC's equipment. The "q" is the sixel identifier. Sixel data then followed the q. The "Stop Text" sequence <ESC>\ returned the device back to normal character mode again.

For printing, sixels are sent to the printer, decoded back into binary, and sent directly to the six pins of the print head. The only complexity involved expanding the RLE's into the internal print buffer. Display on a terminal is somewhat more difficult. On terminals supporting graphics, the [ReGIS] graphics system was used to directly draw the sixel pattern into the screen's bitmap. This was done at high speed by storing the bitmap patterns as a glyph and then bitting them.

When used for defining custom character sets the format was almost identical, although the escape codes changed. In terms of the data, the only major difference was the replacement of the separate CR/LF with a single /. In the VT300 series for instance, 80-column character glyphs were 15 pixels wide by 12 high, meaning that a character could be defined by sending a total of 30 sixels.

Colour was also supported using the # character, followed by a number referring to one of a number of colour registers, which varied from device to device. Colours were defined using either [RGB] or [HSV] values in a peculiar DEC format. On a printer, a line of sixels was sent several times, each representing a single bitplane from the register based colours on the terminals (normally 2 or 4 bits). For non-graphics terminals, colour was simply dropped. Since the capabilities of the hardware varied widely, a colour sixel drawing could only be output to targeted devices.

Run Length Encoding (RLE) 
Run Length Encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs. Consider, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, and animations. It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could greatly increase the file size.

RLE may also be used to refer to an early graphics file format supported by [CompuServe] for compressing black and white images, but was widely supplanted by their later [Graphics Interchange Format]. RLE also refers to a little used image format in [Windows 3.x], with the extension .rle, which is a Run Length Encoded Bitmap, used to compress the Windows 3.x startup screen.

Typical applications of this encoding are when the source information comprises long substrings of the same character or binary digit.

CompuServe
CompuServe (CompuServe Information Service, also known by its acronym CIS) was the first major commercial online service in the United States. It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major player through the mid 1990s, when it was sidelined by the rise of services such as [AOL] with monthly subscriptions rather than hourly rates. Since the purchase of CompuServe's Information Services Division by AOL, it has operated as an online service provider and an Internet service provider. The original CompuServe Information Service, later rebranded as CompuServe Classic, was shut down 1 July 2009. The newer version of the service, CompuServe 2000, continues to operate as an internet portal.

NSI Escape Codes
In computing, ANSI escape codes (or escape sequences) are a method using in-band signaling to control the formatting, colour, and other output options on video text terminals. To encode this formatting information, certain sequences of bytes are embedded into the text, which the terminal looks for and interprets as commands, not as character codes.

ANSI codes were introduced in the 1970s and became widespread in the minicomputer / mainframe market by the early 1980s. They were used by the nascent [bulletin board system] market to offer improved displays compared to earlier systems lacking cursor movement, leading to even more widespread use.

Although hardware text terminals have become increasingly rare in the 21st century, the relevance of the ANSI standard persists because most terminal emulators interpret at least some of the ANSI escape sequences in the output text. One notable exception is the win32 console component of [Microsoft Windows].
===

Mac Terminal
Terminal (Terminal.app) is the terminal emulator included in the [OS X] operating system by [Apple].

Terminal originated in [NeXTSTEP] and OPENSTEP, the predecessor operating systems of OS X.

As a terminal emulator, the application provides text-based access to the operating system, in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience of OS X, by providing a command line interface to the operating system when used in conjunction with a [Unix] shell, such as [bash].

The preferences dialog for Terminal.app in OS X 10.8 ([Mountain Lion]) offers choices for values of the TERM environment variable. Available options are ansi, dtterm, nsterm, rxvt, vt52, vt100, vt102, xterm, xterm-16color and xterm-256color, which differ from the OS X 10.5 ([Leopard]) choices by dropping the xterm-color and adding xterm-16color and xterm-256color. These settings do not alter the operation of Terminal, and the xterm settings do not match the behaviour of xterm.

Terminal includes several features that specifically access OS X APIs and features. These include the ability to use the standard OS X Help search function to find manual pages and integration with Spotlight. Terminal was used by Apple as a showcase for OS X graphics APIs in early advertising of Mac OS X, offering a range of custom font and colouring options, including transparent backgrounds.

Wyse
Wyse is a leading manufacturer of cloud computing systems. They are best known for their video terminal line introduced in the 1980s, which competed with the market leading [DEC]. They also had a successful line of [IBM PC compatible] in the mid to late 1980s, but were outcompeted by companies such as [Dell] starting late in the decade. Current products include thin client hardware and software as well as desktop virtualisation. Other products include cloud software supporting desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices.

On 2 April 2012, Dell and Wyse announced that Dell intends to take over the company. With this acquisition Dell would surpass their rival [Hewlett-Packard] in the market for thin clients. On 25 May 2012 Dell informed the market that it had completed the acquisition of Wyse Technology, which is now known as Dell Wyse.

National Replacement Character Set
The National Replacement Character Set, or NRCS for short, was a feature supported by later models of Digital's ([DEC]) computer terminal systems, starting with the [VT200] series in 1983. NRCS allowed individual characters from one character set to be replaced by one from another set, allowing the construction of different character sets on the fly. It was used to customize the character set to different local languages, without having to change the terminal's [ROM] for different counties, or alternately, include many different sets in a larger ROM. Many 3rd party terminals and terminal emulators supporting VT200 codes also supported NRCS.

[ASCII] is a 7-bit standard, allowing a total of 128 characters in the character set. Some of these are reserved as control characters, leaving 96 printable characters. This set of 96 includes upper and lower case letters, numbers, and basic math and punctuation.

ASCII does not have enough room to include other common characters such as multi-national currency symbols or the various accented letters common in European languages. This led to a number of country specific varieties of 7-bit ASCII with certain characters replaced. For instance, the UK standard simply replaced ASCII's hash mark, #, with the pound symbol, £. This normally led to different models of a given computer terminal or printer, differing only in the [glyphs] stored in ROM. These were standardised as part of ISO/IEC 646.

On an [8-bit clean] serial link, ASCII can be expanded to support a total of 256 characters. In this case, instead of replacing the characters in the original printable characters range from 32 to 127, new characters are added in the 128 to 255 range. This offers enough room for a single character set to include all the variety of characters used in North America and western Europe. This capability led to the introduction of the ISO/IEC 8859-1 standard character set containing 191 characters of what it calls the "Latin alphabet no. 1", but normally referred to as "ISO Latin". [Windows-1252] is a slightly expanded superset of ISO Latin.

NRCS was introduced to solve the problem of requiring different terminals for each country by allowing characters in the basic 7-bit ASCII set to be re-defined by copying the glyph from the DEC's version of ISO Latin, the [Multinational Character Set] (MCS). This meant that the ROM had to store only two character sets, standard ASCII and MCS, and could build any required local ASCII variant on the fly. For instance, instead of having a separate "UK ASCII" version of the terminal with a modified glyph in ROM, the terminal included an NRCS with instructions to replace the hash mark glyph with the pound. When used in the UK, typing Shift 3 produced the pound, the same keys pressed on a US terminal produced hash.

The NRCS could be set through a setup command, or more commonly, by replacing the keyboard with a model that sent back a code when first booted. That way simply plugging in a UK keyboard, which had a pound sign on the 3 key, automatically set the NRSC to that same replacement.
===

Multinational Character Set (MCS)
The Multinational Character Set (MCS) is a character encoding created by [Digital Equipment Corporation] for use in the popular [VT220] terminal. It was an [8-bit] extension of ASCII that added accented characters, currency symbols, and other character [glyphs] missing from 7-bit [ASCII]. It is only one of the code pages implemented for the VT220 [National Replacement Character Set].

Such "[extended ASCII]" sets were common (the National Replacement Character Set provided sets for more than a dozen European languages), but MCS has the distinction of being the ancestor of both [ISO 8859-1] and [Unicode].
===

Extended ASCII
Extended ASCII (or high ASCII) is [8-bit] or larger character encodings that include the standard 7-bit [ASCII] characters as well as others. The use of the term is sometimes criticised, because it can be mistakenly interpreted that the ASCII standard has been updated to include more than 128 characters or that the term unambiguously identifies a single encoding, both of which are untrue.
===

Glyph
In typography, a glyph is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of symbols, intended to represent a readable character for the purposes of writing and thereby expressing thoughts, ideas and concepts. As such, glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word, or otherwise contribute to a specific meaning of what is written, with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage.

For example, in most languages written in any variety of the Latin alphabet the dot on a lower-case i is not a glyph because it does not convey any distinction, and an i in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognised correctly. In Turkish, however, it is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter i, with and without a dot.

In Japanese syllabaries, a number of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark, but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves. However, in some cases, additional marks fulfil the role of diacritics, to differentiate distinct characters. Such additional marks constitute glyphs.

In general, a diacritic is a glyph, even if (like a cedilla in French, the ogonek in several languages or the stroke on a Polish "Ł") it is "joined up" with the rest of the character.

Some characters, such as "æ" in Icelandic and the "ß" in German, would probably be regarded as glyphs: they were originally ligatures but over time have become characters in their own right, and these languages treat them as separate letters. However, a ligature such as "ſi", which is treated in some typefaces as a single unit, is arguably not a glyph as this is just a quirk of the typeface, essentially an allographic feature, and includes more than one grapheme. In normal handwriting, even long words are often written "joined up", without the pen leaving the paper, and the form of each written letter will often vary depending on which letters precede and follow it, but that does not make the whole word into a single glyph.

Two or more glyphs which have the same significance, whether used interchangeably or chosen depending on context, are called allographs of each other.
===

8-bit Clean
8-bit clean describes a computer system that correctly handles [8-bit] character encodings, such as the [ISO 8859] series and the [UTF-8] encoding of [Unicode].

Up to the early 1990s, many programs and data transmission channels assumed that all characters would be represented as numbers between 0 and 127 (7 bits). On computers and data links using 8-bit bytes this left the top bit of each byte free for use as a parity, flag bit, or meta data control bit. 7-bit systems and data links are unable to handle more complex character codes which are commonplace in non-English speaking countries with larger alphabets.

Binary files cannot be transmitted through 7-bit data channels directly. To work around this, binary-to-text encodings have been devised which use only 7-bit [ASCII] characters. Some of these encodings are uuencoding, Ascii85, SREC, BinHex, kermit and [MIME]'s [Base64]. EBCDIC-based systems cannot handle all characters used in UUencoded data. However, the base64 encoding does not have this problem.

RS-232
In telecommunications, RS-232 is a standard for serial communication transmission of data. It formally defines the signals connecting between a DTE (data terminal equipment) such as a computer terminal, and a DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment, originally defined as data communication equipment), such as a modem. The RS-232 standard is commonly used in computer serial ports. The standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals, the meaning of signals, and the physical size and pinout of connectors. The current version of the standard is TIA-232-F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange, issued in 1997.

An RS-232 serial port was once a standard feature of a personal computer, used for connections to [modems], printers, mice, data storage, uninterruptible power supplies, and other peripheral devices. However, RS-232 is hampered by low transmission speed, large voltage swing, and large standard connectors. In modern personal computers, [USB] has displaced RS-232 from most of its peripheral interface roles. Many computers do not come equipped with RS-232 ports and must use either an external USB-to-RS-232 converter or an internal expansion card with one or more serial ports to connect to RS-232 peripherals. Nevertheless, RS-232 devices are still used, especially in industrial machines, networking equipment and scientific instruments.

Centronics Data Computer Corporation
Centronics Data Computer Corporation was an American manufacturer of computer printers, now remembered primarily for the [parallel interface] that bears its name.

Centronics began as a division of [Wang Laboratories]. Founded and initially operated by Robert Howard (president) and Samuel Lang (vice president and owner of the well known K & L Color Photo Service Lab in New York City), the group produced remote terminals and systems for the casino industry. Printers were developed to print receipts and transaction reports. Wang spun off the business in 1971 and Centronics was formed as a corporation in Hudson, New Hampshire with Howard as president and chairman.

The Centronics Model 101 was introduced at the 1970 National Computer Conference. The print head used an innovative seven-wire solenoid impact system. Based on this design, Centronics later made the claim to have developed the first dot matrix impact printer.

Howard developed a personal relationship with his neighbour, Max Hugel, the founder and president of [Brother International], the United States arm of Brother Industries, Ltd., a manufacturer of sewing machines and typewriters. A business relationship developed when Centronics needed reliable manufacturing of the printer mechanisms a relationship that would help propel Brother into the printer industry. Hugel would later become executive vice president of Centronics. Print heads and electronics were built in Centronics plants in New Hampshire and Ireland, mechanisms were built in Japan by Brother and the printers were assembled in New Hampshire.

In the 1970s, Centronics formed a relationship with Canon to develop non-impact printers. No products were ever produced, but Canon continued to work on laser printers, eventually developing a highly successful series of engines.

In 1977, Centronics sued competitor Mannesmann AG in a patent dispute regarding the return spring used in the print actuator.

In 1975, Centronics formed an [OEM] agreement with [Tandy] and produced DMP and LP series printers for several years. The 6000 series band printers were introduced in 1978. By 1979 company revenues were over $100 million.

In 1980, the Mini-Printer Model 770 was introduced a small, low-cost desktop serial matrix printer. This was the first printer built completely in-house, and there were problems. Flaws in the microprocessor led to a recall and a stoppage of manufacturing for a year. During this period, Epson, Brother and others began to gain market share and Centronics never recovered. 1980 also saw the introduction of the E Series 900 and 1200 LPM band printers.

Dot Matrix Printing
Dot matrix printing or impact matrix printing is a type of computer printing which uses a print head that moves back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.

In the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix impact printers were generally considered the best combination of expense and versatility, and until the 1990s they were by far the most common form of printer used with personal and home computers.

The [Epson] MX-80, introduced in 1979, was the groundbreaking model that sparked the initial popularity of impact printers in the personal computer market. The MX-80 combined affordability with good quality text output (for its time). Early impact printers (including the MX) were notoriously loud during operation, a result of the hammer like mechanism in the print head. The MX-80 even inspired the name of a noise rock band. The MX-80's low dot density (60 dpi horizontal, 72 dpi vertical) produced printouts of a distinctive "computerised" quality. When compared to the crisp typewriter quality of a daisy-wheel printer, the dot-matrix printer's legibility appeared especially bad. In office applications, output quality was a serious issue, as the dot-matrix text's readability would rapidly degrade with each photocopy generation. [IBM] sold the MX-80 as IBM 5125.

Wang Laboratories
Wang Laboratories was a computer company founded in 1951 by Dr. An Wang and Dr. G. Y. Chu. The company was successively headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1954 – 1963), Tewksbury, Massachusetts (1963 – 1976), and finally in Lowell, Massachusetts (1976 – 1997). At its peak in the 1980s, Wang Laboratories had annual revenues of $3 billion and employed over 33,000 people.

The company was directed by Dr. Wang, who was described as an "indispensable leader" and played a personal role in setting business and product strategy until his death in 1990. Under his direction, the company went through several distinct transitions between different product lines.

Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection in August 1992. After emerging from bankruptcy, the company eventually changed its name to Wang Global. Wang Global was acquired by Getronics of The Netherlands in 1999, becoming Getronics North America, then was sold to KPN in 2007 and CompuCom in 2008, after which it no longer existed as a distinct brand or division.

Tandy
Tandy Leather, which later grew in to the Tandy Corporation, was a family owned leather goods company based in Fort Worth, Texas. Tandy Leather was founded in 1919 as a leather supply store, and acquired a number of craft retail companies, including RadioShack in 1963. In 2000, the Tandy Corporation name was dropped and entity became the RadioShack Corporation, selling The Tandy Leather name and operating assets to The Leather Factory.

Parallel Port
A parallel port is a type of interface found on computers (personal and otherwise) for connecting peripherals. In computing, a parallel port is a parallel communication physical interface. It is also known as a printer port or Centronics port. It was an industry de facto standard for many years, and was finally standardised as IEEE 1284 in the late 1990s, which defined the Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) and Extended Capability Port (ECP) bi-directional versions. Today, the parallel port interface is seeing decreasing use because of the rise of Universal Serial Bus ([USB]) devices, along with network printing using [Ethernet].

The parallel port interface was originally known as the Parallel Printer Adapter on [IBM PC compatible] computers. It was primarily designed to operate a line printer that used [IBM]'s [8-bit] extended [ASCII] character set to print text, but could also be used to adapt other peripherals. Graphical printers, along with a host of other devices, have been designed to communicate with the system.

The term "Centronics port" now commonly refers to an IEEE-1284 Type B or 36-pin micro ribbon interface. The first parallel interface for printers was introduced with the [Centronics] Model 101 printer in 1970. The interface was developed by Dr. An Wang, Robert Howard and Prentice Robinson at Centronics. [Wang] had a surplus stock of 20,000 Amphenol 36-pin micro ribbon connectors that were originally used for one of their early calculators, which they used to create the Centronics interface on their computers. The connector has become so closely associated with Centronics that it is now popularly known as the “Centronics connector”.

The Centronics parallel interface quickly became an industry de facto standard; manufacturers of the time tended to use various connectors on the system side, so a variety of cables were required. For example, early [VAX] systems used a DC-37 connector, NCR used the 36-pin micro ribbon connector, [Texas Instruments] used a 25-pin card edge connector and [Data General] used a 50-pin micro ribbon connector.

When IBM implemented the parallel interface on the IBM PC, they used the DB-25F connector at the PC-end of the interface, creating the now familiar parallel cable with a DB25M at one end and a 36 pin micro ribbon connector at the other. [HP] adopted Centronics parallel on their printer models and introduced a bidirectional version known as Bitronics on the LaserJet 4 in 1992. The Bitronics and Centronics interfaces were superseded by the IEEE 1284 standard in 1994.

Centronics parallel is generally compliant with IEEE 1284 compatibility mode. The original Centronics implementation called for the busy lead to toggle with each received line of data (busy by line), whereas IEEE 1284 calls for busy to toggle with each received character (busy by character). Some host systems or print servers may use a strobe signal with a relatively low voltage output or a fast toggle. Any of these issues might cause no or intermittent printing, missing or repeated characters or garbage printing. Some printer models may have a switch or setting to set busy by character; others may require a handshake adapter.

Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments Inc is an American electronics company that designs and makes semiconductors, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. Headquartered at Dallas, Texas, United States, TI is the third largest manufacturer of semiconductors worldwide after [Intel] and [Samsung], the second largest supplier of chips for cellular handsets after Qualcomm, and the largest producer of digital signal processors (DSPs) and analog semiconductors, among a wide range of other semiconductor products, including calculators, microcontrollers and multi-core processors. Texas Instruments is among the Top 20 Semiconductor producing companies in the world.

Texas Instruments was founded in 1951. It emerged after a reorganisation of Geophysical Service. This company manufactured equipment for use in the seismic industry as well as defence electronics. TI began research in transistors in the early 1950s and produced the world's first commercial silicon transistor. In 1954, Texas Instruments designed and manufactured the first transistor radio and Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit in 1958 while working at TI's Central Research Labs. The company produced the first integrated circuit-based computer for the U.S. Air Force in 1961. TI researched infrared technology in the late 1950s and later made radar systems as well as guidance and control systems for both missiles and bombs. The hand-held calculator was introduced to the world by TI in 1967.

In the 1970s and 80s the company focused on consumer electronics including digital clocks, watches, hand-held calculators, home computers as well as various sensors. In 1997, its defence business was sold to Raytheon. In 2007, Texas Instruments was awarded the Manufacturer of the Year for Global Supply Chain Excellence by World Trade magazine. Texas Instruments is considered to be one of the most ethical companies in the world.

After the acquisition of National Semiconductor in 2011, the company has a combined portfolio of nearly 45,000 analog products and customer design tools, making it the world's largest maker of analog technology components. In 2011, Texas Instruments ranked 175 in the Fortune 500. TI is made up of two main divisions: Semiconductors (SC) and Educational Technology (ET) of which Semiconductor products account for approximately 96% of TI's revenue.

National Semiconductor
National Semiconductor was an American semiconductor manufacturer which specialised in analog devices and subsystems, formerly headquartered in Santa Clara, California, United States. The company produced power management integrated circuits, display drivers, audio and operational amplifiers, communication interface products and data conversion solutions. National's key markets included wireless handsets, displays and a variety of broad electronics markets, including medical, automotive, industrial and test and measurement applications.

On 23 September 2011, the company formally became part of [Texas Instruments] as the "[Silicon Valley]" division.
===

Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley is a nickname for the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area in California, United States. It is home to many of the world's largest high-tech corporations, as well as thousands of tech startup companies. The region occupies roughly the same area as the Santa Clara Valley where it is centered, including San Jose and surrounding cities and towns. The term originally referred to the large number of silicon chip innovators and manufacturers in the region, but eventually came to refer to all high tech businesses in the area, and is now generally used as a metonym for the American high-technology economic sector.

Silicon Valley is a leading hub and startup ecosystem for high-tech innovation and development, accounting for one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States. Geographically, Silicon Valley is generally thought to encompass all of the Santa Clara Valley, San Francisco, the San Francisco Peninsula, and southern portions of the East Bay.

Data General 
Data General was one of the first minicomputer firms from the late 1960s. Three of the four founders were former employees of [Digital Equipment Corporation]. Their first product, the Data General Nova, was a 16-bit minicomputer. This used their own operating system, RDOS, and in conjunction with programming languages like "Data General Business Basic" they provided a multi-user operating system with record locking and built-in databases far ahead of many contemporary systems. The Nova was followed by the Supernova and Eclipse product lines, all of which were used in many applications for the next two decades. The company employed an Original Equipment Manufacturer ([OEM]) sales strategy to sell to third parties who incorporated Data General computers into the OEM's specific product lines. A series of missteps in the 1980s, including missing the advance of microcomputers despite the launch of the microNOVA in 1977, and the Data General-One portable computer in 1984, led to a decline in the company's market share. The company did continue into the 1990s, however, and was eventually acquired by EMC Corporation in 1999.

USB - Universal Serial Bus
USB, short for Universal Serial Bus, is an industry standard developed in the mid 1990s that defines the cables, connectors and communications protocols used in a bus for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and electronic devices.

USB was designed to standardise the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices.

USB 1.x
Released in January 1996, USB 1.0 specified data rates of 1.5 Mbit/s (Low Bandwidth or Low Speed) and 12 Mbit/s (Full Bandwidth or Full Speed). It did not allow for extension cables or pass-through monitors, due to timing and power limitations. Few USB devices made it to the market until USB 1.1 was released in August 1998, fixing problems identified in 1.0, mostly related to using hubs. USB 1.1 was the earliest revision that was widely adopted.

USB 2.0
USB 2.0 was released in April 2000, adding a higher maximum signalling rate of 480 Mbit/s called High Speed, in addition to the USB 1.x Full Speed signalling rate of 12 Mbit/s. Due to bus access constraints, the effective throughput of the High Speed signalling rate is limited to 35 MB/s or 280 Mbit/s.

Further modifications to the USB specification have been made via Engineering Change Notices (ECN). The most important of these ECNs are included into the USB 2.0 specification package available from USB.org.

- Mini-A and Mini-B Connector ECN: Released in October 2000.
	- Specifications for mini-A and B plug and receptacle. Also receptacle that accepts both plugs for On-The-Go. These should not be confused with micro-B plug and receptacle.
- Pull-up/Pull-down Resistors ECN: Released in May 2002
	- Interface Associations ECN: Released in May 2003.
	- New standard descriptor was added that allows associating multiple interfaces with a single device function.
- Rounded Chamfer ECN: Released in October 2003.
	- A recommended, backward compatible change to mini-B plugs that results in longer lasting connectors.
- Unicode ECN: Released in February 2005.
	- This ECN specifies that strings are encoded using UTF-16LE. USB 2.0 specified Unicode, but did not specify the encoding.
- Inter-Chip USB Supplement: Released in March 2006
- On-The-Go Supplement 1.3: Released in December 2006.
	- USB On-The-Go makes it possible for two USB devices to communicate with each other without requiring a separate USB host. In practice, one of the USB devices acts as a host for the other device.
- Battery Charging Specification 1.1: Released in March 2007 and updated on 15 April 2009.
	- Adds support for dedicated chargers (power supplies with USB connectors), host chargers (USB hosts that can act as chargers) and the No Dead Battery provision, which allows devices to temporarily draw 100 mA current after they have been attached. If a USB device is connected to dedicated charger, maximum current drawn by the device may be as high as 1.8 A. (Note that this document is not distributed with USB 2.0 specification package, only USB 3.0 and USB On-The-Go.)
- Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification 1.01: Released in April 2007.
- Link Power Management Addendum ECN: Released in July 2007.
	- This adds "sleep", a new power state between enabled and suspended states. Device in this state is not required to reduce its power consumption. However, switching between enabled and sleep states is much faster than switching between enabled and suspended states, which allows devices to sleep while idle.
- Battery Charging Specification 1.2 Released in December 2010.
	- Several changes and increasing limits including allowing 1.5 A on charging ports for unconfigured devices, allowing High Speed communication while having a current up to 1.5 A and allowing a maximum current of 5 A.

USB 3.0
USB 3.0 standard was released in November 2008, defining a new SuperSpeed mode. A USB 3.0 port, usually coloured blue, is backward compatible with USB 2.0 devices and cables.

The USB 3.0 Promoter Group announced on 17 November 2008 that the specification of version 3.0 had been completed and had made the transition to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), the managing body of USB specifications. This move effectively opened the specification to hardware developers for implementation in products.

The new SuperSpeed bus provides a fourth transfer mode with a data signalling rate of 5.0 Gbit/s, in addition to the modes supported by earlier versions. The payload throughput is 4 Gbit/s (due to the overhead induced by used 8b/10b encoding), and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve around 3.2 Gbit/s (0.4 GB/s or 400 MB/s), which should increase with future hardware advances. Communication is full-duplex in SuperSpeed transfer mode; in the modes supported previously, by 1.x and 2.0, communication is half-duplex, with direction controlled by the host.

As with previous USB versions, USB 3.0 ports come in low-power and high-power variants, providing 150 mA and 900 mA respectively, while simultaneously transmitting data at SuperSpeed rates. Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2 – December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5 A but does not allow concurrent data transmission. The Battery Charging Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5 A of current but limits the maximum current drawn to 1.5 A.

USB 3.1
A January 2013 press release from the USB group revealed plans to update USB 3.0 to 10 Gbit/s. The group ended up creating a new USB version, USB 3.1, which was released on 31 July 2013, introducing a faster transfer mode called "SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbit/s", putting it on par with a single first-generation Thunderbolt channel. The new mode's logo features a "Superspeed+" caption (stylised as SUPERSPEED+). The USB 3.1 standard increases the data signalling rate to 10 Gbit/s in the USB 3.1 Gen2 mode, double that of USB 3.0 (referred to as USB 3.1 Gen1) and reduces line encoding overhead to just 3% by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b. The first USB 3.1 implementation demonstrated transfer speeds of 7.2 Gbit/s.

The USB 3.1 standard is backward compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0.

USB Type-C
Developed at roughly the same time as the USB 3.1 specification, but distinct from it, the USB Type-C Specification 1.0 defines a new small reversible plug connector for USB devices. The Type-C plug connects to both hosts and devices, replacing various Type-B and Type-A connectors and cables with a standard meant to be future proof, similar to [Apple] Lightning and Thunderbolt. The 24-pin double-sided connector provides four power / ground pairs, two differential pairs for USB 2.0 data bus (though only one pair is implemented in a Type-C cable), four pairs for high-speed data bus, two "sideband use" pins, and two configuration pins for cable orientation detection, dedicated biphase mark code (BMC) configuration data channel, and VCONN +5 V power for active cables. Type-A and Type-B adaptors and cables will be required for older devices in order to plug into Type-C hosts; adaptors and cables with a Type-C receptacle are not allowed.

Full-featured USB Type-C cables are active, electronically marked cables that contain a chip with an ID function based on the configuration data channel and vendor defined messages (VDMs) from the USB Power Delivery 2.0 specification. USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5 A and 3.0 A over the 5 V power bus in addition to baseline 900 mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line, or they can support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.

Alternate Mode dedicates some of the physical wires in the Type-C cable for direct device-to-host transmission of alternate data protocols. The four high-speed lanes, two sideband pins, and—​for dock, detachable device and permanent cable applications only two USB 2.0 pins and one configuration pin can be used for Alternate Mode transmission. The modes are configured using VDMs through the configuration channel.

Sound Blaster
The Sound Blaster family of sound cards was the de facto standard for consumer audio on the [IBM PC compatible] system platform, until the widespread transition to [Microsoft Windows 95], which standardised the programming interface at application level (eliminating the importance of backward compatibility with Sound Blaster), and the evolution in PC design led to onboard motherboard-audio, which commoditised PC audio functionality.

The creator of Sound Blaster is the Singapore based firm [Creative Technology Limited], also known by the name of its United States subsidiary, Creative Labs.

Sound Blaster 16
The Sound Blaster 16, announced in June 1992, introduced:

- 16-bit CD-quality digital audio sampling;
- An MPU-401 compatible UART;
- A socket for the optional Advanced Signal Processor or Creative Signal Processor chip (ASP or later CSP); and
- A connector for the Wave Blaster, a 'Wavetable' daughterboard (sample-based synthesis).

The Sound Blaster 16 retained the Yamaha OPL-3 for FM synthesis and a backward compatible programming interface, so most software titles written for the older Sound Blasters and Sound Blaster Pros would run without modification.

Eventually this design proved so popular that Creative made a [PCI] version of this card. Moving the card off the [ISA] bus, which was already approaching obsolescence, meant that no line for host controlled ISA DMA was available, as the PCI slot offers no such line. Instead, the card used PCI bus mastering to transfer data from the main memory to the D/A converters. Since existing [DOS] programs expected to be able to initiate host controlled ISA DMA for producing sound, backward compatibility with the older Sound Blaster cards for DOS programs required a software driver work around; since this work around necessarily depended on the virtual [8086] mode of the PC's CPU in order to catch and reroute accesses from the ISA DMA controller to the card itself, it failed for a number of DOS games that either were not fully compatible with this CPU mode or needed so much free conventional memory that they could not be loaded with the driver occupying part of this memory. In [Microsoft Windows], there was no problem, as Creative's Windows driver software could handle both ISA and PCI cards correctly.

Sound Blaster AWE32
Released in March 1994, the Sound Blaster AWE32 (Advanced Wave Effects) introduced an all new MIDI synthesizer section based on the EMU8000. The AWE32 consisted of two distinct audio sections; the Creative digital audio section (audio codec, optional CSP/ASP chip socket, Yamaha OPL3), and the E-mu MIDI synthesizer section. The synthesizer section consisted of the EMU8000 sampler and effects processor, an EMU8011 1 MB sample ROM, and 512 KB of sample RAM (expandable to 28 MB). To fit the new hardware, the AWE32 was a full-length ISA card, measuring 14 in (360 mm).

Sound Blaster 32
A derivative of the AWE32 design, the Sound Blaster 32 (SB32) was a value-oriented offering from Creative. Announced on 6 June 1995, the SB32 became the new entry-level card in the AWE32 product-line (previously held by the AWE32 Value). The SB32 retained the AWE32's EMU8000/EMU8011 MIDI-synthesis engine and built-in instrument ROM, but dropped the onboard RAM, the Wave Blaster header, and the CSP port. The SB32 used the Vibra chip to reduce component count, which meant bass/treble/gain control was limited compared to the AWE32. The loss of onboard RAM is offset by the inclusion of 30-pin SIMM RAM sockets, which allow up to 8 MB RAM to be installed and used by the EMU engine.

Sound Blaster AWE64
The AWE32's successor, the Sound Blaster AWE64 (November 1996), was significantly smaller, being a "half-length ISA card". It offered similar features to the AWE32, but also had a few notable improvements, including support for greater polyphony, although this was a product of 32 extra software emulated channels. The 30-pin SIMM slots from AWE32/SB32 were replaced with a proprietary memory format which could be (expensively) purchased from Creative.

The main improvements were better compatibility with older SB models, and an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The AWE64 came in three versions: A Value version (with 512KB of RAM), a Standard version (with 1 MB of RAM), and a Gold version (with 4 MB of RAM and a separate S/PDIF output).

Industry Standard Architecture (ISA)
Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is a retronym term for the [16-bit] internal bus of [IBM PC/AT] and similar computers based on the [Intel 80286] and its immediate successors during the 1980s. The bus was (largely) backward compatible with the [8-bit] bus of the [8088] based [IBM PC], including the [IBM PC/XT] as well as [IBM PC compatibles].

Originally referred to as the PC/AT-bus it was also termed I/O Channel by [IBM]. The ISA concept was coined by competing PC-clone manufacturers in the late 1980s or early 1990s as a reaction to IBM attempts to replace the AT-bus with its new and incompatible Micro Channel architecture.

The 16-bit ISA bus was used also with 32-bit processors for several years. An attempt to extend it to 32 bits, called Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), was not very successful, however. Later buses such as [VESA Local Bus] and [PCI] were used instead, often along with ISA slots on the same mainboard. A derivative of the AT bus structure is still used in the PCMCIA standard, Compact Flash, the PC/104 bus, and internally within Super I/O chips.
===

Conventional PCI
Conventional PCI, often shortened to PCI, is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer. PCI is the initialism for Peripheral Component Interconnect and is part of the PCI Local Bus standard. The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardised format that is independent of any particular processor's native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.

Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in [IBM PC compatibles], where it displaced the combination of several slow [ISA] slots and one fast [VESA Local Bus] slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as [USB] or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became AGP, itself a superset of conventional PCI, before giving way to PCI Express.

The first version of conventional PCI found in consumer desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33 MHz bus clock and 5 V signalling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one locating notch in the card. Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3 V slots, physically distinguished by a flipped physical connector to preventing accidental insertion of 5 V cards. Universal cards, which can operate on either voltage, have two notches. Version 2.1 of the PCI standard introduced optional 66 MHz operation. A server-oriented variant of conventional PCI, called PCI-X (PCI Extended) operated at frequencies up to 133 MHz for PCI-X 1.0 and up to 533 MHz for PCI-X 2.0. An internal connector for laptop cards, called Mini PCI, was introduced in version 2.2 of the PCI specification. The PCI bus was also adopted for an external laptop connector standard—the CardBus. The first PCI specification was developed by Intel, but subsequent development of the standard became the responsibility of the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG).

Conventional PCI and PCI-X are sometimes called Parallel PCI in order to distinguish them technologically from their more recent successor PCI Express, which adopted a serial, lane-based architecture. Conventional PCI's heyday in the desktop computer market was approximately the decade 1995 - 2005. PCI and PCI-X have become obsolete for most purposes; however, they are still common on modern desktops for the purposes of backwards compatibility and the low relative cost to produce. Many kinds of devices previously available on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and PCI Express versions.

VESA Local Bus 
The VESA Local Bus (usually abbreviated to VL-Bus or VLB) was mostly used in personal computers. VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) Local Bus worked alongside the [ISA] bus; it acted as a high-speed conduit for memory-mapped I/O and DMA, while the ISA bus handled interrupts and port-mapped I/O.

Creative Technology
Creative Technology Ltd is a Singapore based global company headquartered in Jurong East, Singapore. The principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries consist of the design, manufacture and distribution of digitised sound and video boards, computers and related multimedia, and personal digital entertainment products.

It also partners with mainboard manufacturers and laptop brands to embed its [Sound Blaster] technology on their products.

DOSBox
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates an [IBM PC compatible] computer running a [DOS] operating system. Many IBM PC compatible graphics and sound cards are also emulated. This means that original DOS programs (including PC games) are provided an environment in which they can run correctly, even though the modern computers have dropped support for that old environment. DOSBox is free software written primarily in [C++] and distributed under the [GNU General Public License]. DOSBox has been downloaded over 25 million times since its release on SourceForge in 2002.

DOSBox can run old DOS software on modern computers which would not work otherwise, because of incompatibilities between the older software and modern hardware and operating systems.

A number of usability enhancements have been added to DOSBox beyond emulating DOS. The added features include virtual hard drives, peer-to-peer networking, screen capture and screencasting from the emulated screen.

The original DOSBox has not been updated in a long time. Active development is happening on forks of DOSBox. Forks such as SVN Daum and DOSBox-X provide additional features, which include support for save states and long filenames.

A number of vintage DOS games have been re-released by video game developers to run on modern computers by encapsulating them inside DOSBox.

Character Encoding
In computing, a character encoding is used to represent a repertoire of characters by some kind of an encoding system. Depending on the abstraction level and context, corresponding code points and the resulting code space may be regarded as bit patterns, octets, natural numbers, electrical pulses, etc. A character encoding is used in computation, data storage, and transmission of textual data. Terms such as character set, character map, codeset or code page are sometimes used as near synonyms; however, these terms have related but distinct meanings described in the article.

Early character codes associated with the optical or electrical telegraph could only represent a subset of the characters used in written languages, sometimes restricted to upper case letters, numerals and some punctuation only. The low cost of digital representation of data in modern computer systems allows more elaborate character codes (such as [Unicode]) which represent more of the characters used in many written languages. Character encoding using internationally accepted standards permits worldwide interchange of text in electronic form.

ISO/IEC 8859-1
ISO/IEC 8859-1 is a [8-bit] single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of [ASCII] based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1987. It is generally intended for Western European languages. It is the basis for most popular 8-bit character sets, including [Windows-1252] and the first block of characters in [Unicode].

ISO-8859-1 is the IANA preferred name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. The following other aliases are registered for ISO-8859-1: iso-ir-100, csISOLatin1, latin1, l1, IBM819, CP819.

The Windows-1252 codepage coincides with ISO-8859-1 for all codes except the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F), where the little used C1 controls are replaced with additional characters including all the missing characters provided by ISO-8859-15. Code page 28591 a.k.a. Windows-28591 is the actual ISO-8859-1 codepage.
===

UTF-8
UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters, or code points, in [Unicode].

The encoding is variable length and uses [8-bit] code units. It was designed for backward compatibility with [ASCII], and to avoid the complications of endianness and byte order marks in the alternative [UTF-16] and [UTF-32] encodings. The name is derived from: Universal Coded Character Set + Transformation Format—8-bit.

UTF-8 is the dominant character encoding for the [World Wide Web], accounting for 84.3% of all Web pages in July 2015. The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) recommends that all e-mail programs be able to display and create mail using UTF-8, and the [W3C] recommends UTF-8 as the default encoding in [XML] and [HTML].

UTF-8 encodes each of the 1,112,064 valid code points in the Unicode code space (1,114,112 code points minus 2,048 surrogate code points) using one to four 8-bit bytes (a group of 8 bits is known as an octet in the Unicode Standard). Code points with lower numerical values (i.e., earlier code positions in the Unicode character set, which tend to occur more frequently) are encoded using fewer bytes. The first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII, making valid ASCII text valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well. And ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non-ASCII code points into UTF-8, making UTF-8 safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special way, e.g. as end of string.
===
UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 possible characters in Unicode. The encoding is variable-length, as code points are encoded with one or two 16-bit code units. (also see Comparison of Unicode encodings for a comparison of UTF-8, -16 & -32)

UTF-16 developed from an earlier fixed-width 16-bit encoding known as UCS-2 (for 2-byte Universal Character Set) once it became clear that a fixed-width 2-byte encoding could not encode enough characters to be truly universal.
===
UTF-32 (or UCS-4) stands for Unicode Transformation Format 32 bits. It is a protocol to encode Unicode characters that uses exactly 32 bits per Unicode code point. This makes UTF-32 a fixed-length encoding, in contrast to all other Unicode transformation formats which are variable-length encodings. The UTF-32 form of a character is a direct representation of its codepoint.[1]

The main advantage of UTF-32, versus variable-length encodings, is that the Unicode code points are directly indexable. Examining the n'th code point is a constant time operation.[2] In contrast, a variable-length code requires sequential access to find the n'th code point. This makes UTF-32 a simple replacement in code that uses integers to index characters out of strings, as was commonly done for ASCII.

The main disadvantage of UTF-32 is that it is space inefficient, using four bytes per character. Non-BMP characters are so rare in most texts[citation needed], they may as well be considered non-existent for sizing issues, making UTF-32 up to twice the size of UTF-16 and up to four times the size of UTF-8.

Windows-1252 or CP-1252 is a character encoding of the Latin alphabet, used by default in the legacy components of Microsoft Windows in English and some other Western languages. It is one version within the group of Windows code pages.

This character encoding is a superset of ISO 8859-1, but differs from the IANA's ISO-8859-1 by using displayable characters rather than control characters in the 80 to 9F (hex) range. Notable additional characters are curly quotation marks, the Euro sign, and all the printable characters that are in ISO 8859-15. It is known to Windows by the code page number 1252, and by the IANA-approved name "windows‑1252".

It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the charset label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by "smart quotes" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the MIME charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling. This is now standard behavior in the HTML 5 specification, which requires that documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 encoding.[1]

Historically, the phrase "ANSI Code Page" (ACP) is used in Windows to refer to various code pages considered as native. The intention was that most of these would be ANSI standards such as ISO-8859-1. Even though Windows-1252 was the first and by far most popular code page named so in Microsoft Windows parlance, the code page has never been an ANSI standard. Microsoft explains, "The term ANSI as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference, but is nowadays a misnomer that continues to persist in the Windows community."[2]


===
Windows code pages are sets of characters or code pages (known as character encodings in other operating systems) used in Microsoft Windows from the 1980s and 1990s. Windows code pages were gradually superseded when Unicode was implemented in Windows, although they are still supported both within Windows and other platforms.

There are two groups of code pages in Windows systems: OEM and ANSI code pages. Code pages in both of these groups are extended ASCII code pages.

ANSI code page[edit]
ANSI code pages (officially called "Windows code pages"[1] after Microsoft accepted the former term being a misnomer[2]) are used for native non-Unicode (say, byte oriented) applications using a graphical user interface on Windows systems. ANSI Windows code pages, and especially the code page 1252, were called that way since they were purportedly based on drafts submitted or intended for ANSI. However, ANSI and ISO have not standardized any of these code pages. Instead they are either supersets of the standard sets such as those of ISO 8859 and the various national standards (like Windows-1252 vs. ISO-8859-1), major modifications of these (making them incompatible to various degrees, like Windows-1250 vs. ISO-8859-2) or having no parallel encoding (like Windows-1257 vs. ISO-8859-4; ISO-8859-13 was introduced much later).[2] About twelve of the typography and business characters from CP1252 at code points 0x80–0x9F (in ISO 8859 occupied by C1 control codes, which are useless in Windows) are present in many other ANSI/Windows code pages at the same codes. These code pages are labelled by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as "Windows-number".[3]

OEM code page[edit]
The OEM code pages (original equipment manufacturer) are used by Win32 console applications, and by virtual DOS, and can be considered a holdover from DOS and the original IBM PC architecture. A separate suite of code pages was implemented not only due to compatibility, but also because the fonts of VGA (and descendant) hardware suggest encoding of line drawing characters to be compatible with code page 437. Most OEM code pages share many code points, particularly for non-letter characters, with the second (non-ASCII) half of CP437.

A typical OEM code page, in its second half, does not resemble any ANSI/Windows code page even roughly. Nevertheless, two single-byte, fixed-width code pages (874 for Thai and 1258 for Vietnamese) and four multibyte CJK code pages (932, 936, 949, 950) are used as both OEM and ANSI code pages. Code page 1258 uses combining diacritics, as Vietnamese requires more than 128 letter-diacritic combinations. This is in contrast to VISCII, which replaces some of the C0 (i.e. ASCII) control codes.

The following Windows code pages exist:

Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Character Set standard and published as The Unicode Standard, the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 120,000 characters covering 129 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts).[1] As of June 2015, the most recent version is Unicode 8.0. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium.

Unicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the internationalization and localization of computer software. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including modern operating systems, XML, the Java programming language, and the Microsoft .NET Framework.

Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and the now-obsolete UCS-2. UTF-8 uses one byte for any ASCII character, all of which have the same code values in both UTF-8 and ASCII encoding, and up to four bytes for other characters. UCS-2 uses a 16-bit code unit (two 8-bit bytes) for each character but cannot encode every character in the current Unicode standard. UTF-16 extends UCS-2, using one 16-bit unit for the characters that were representable in UCS-2 and two 16-bit units (4 × 8 bit) to handle each of the additional characters.

The Universal Coded Character Set (UCS), defined by the International Standard ISO/IEC 10646, Information technology — Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) (plus amendments to that standard), is a standard set of characters upon which many character encodings are based. The UCS contains nearly one hundred thousand abstract characters, each identified by an unambiguous name and an integer number called its code point.

Characters (letters, numbers, symbols, ideograms, logograms, etc.) from the many languages, scripts, and traditions of the world are represented in the UCS with unique code points. The inclusiveness of the UCS is continually improving as characters from previously unrepresented writing systems are added.

Since 1991, the Unicode Consortium has worked with ISO to develop The Unicode Standard ("Unicode") and ISO/IEC 10646 in tandem. The repertoire, character names, and code points of Version 2.0 of Unicode exactly match those of ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993 with its first seven published amendments. After the publication of Unicode 3.0 in February 2000, corresponding new and updated characters entered the UCS via ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000. In 2003, parts 1 and 2 of ISO/IEC 10646 were combined into a single part, which has since had a number of amendments adding characters to the standard in approximate synchrony with the Unicode standard.

The UCS has over 1.1 million code points available for use, but only the first 65,536 (the Basic Multilingual Plane, or BMP) had entered into common use before 2000. This situation began changing when the People's Republic of China (PRC) ruled in 2000 that all software sold in its jurisdiction would have to support GB 18030. This required software intended for sale in the PRC to move beyond the BMP.

The system deliberately leaves many code points not assigned to characters, even in the BMP. It does this to allow for future expansion or to minimize conflicts with other encoding forms.

DECmate was the name of a series of PDP-8-compatible computers produced by the Digital Equipment Corporation in the late 1970s and early 1980s. All of the models used an Intersil 6100 (later known as the Harris 6100) or Harris 6120 (an improved Intersil 6100) microprocessor which emulated the 12-bit DEC PDP-8 CPU. They were text-only and used the OS/78 or OS/278 operating systems, which were extensions of OS/8 for the PDP-8. Aimed for the word processing market, they typically ran the WPS-8 word-processing program.

Later models optionally had Intel 8080 or Z80 microprocessors which allowed them to run CP/M.

The range was a development of the VT78 which was introduced in July 1977.

DECmate[edit]
Introduced in 1980, this machine was built into a VT100 case. It had a 10 MHz clock and 32 Kwords of memory. It was also known as the VT278.

DECmate II[edit]
As part of a three-pronged strategy against IBM, the company released this model at the same time as the PDP-11-based PRO-380 and the Intel 8088-based Rainbow 100.

The DECmate II resembles the Rainbow 100 but uses the 6120 processor. Its two operating systems are the WPS-8 word processing system, and the COS-310 Commercial Operating System running DIBOL.[1] Like the others it had a monochrome VR201 (VT220-style) monitor, an LK201 keyboard and dual 400K single-sided quad-density 5.25 inch RX50 floppy disk drives. It had 32 Kwords of RAM for use by programs, and a further 32 Kwords containing code which was used for device emulation. Code running in this second bank was nicknamed "slushware", in contrast to firmware since it was loaded from floppy disk as the machine booted. It was also known as the PC278.

It could be expanded, either by adding another pair of 5.25 inch floppy disk drives, and it could also support either an additional pair of RX01 or RX02 8-inch floppy disk drives or a winchester disk.

It can also have a coprocessor board added, to allow it to run CP/M.[1] There was a choice of three coprocessor boards, one with a Z80 and 64 KB RAM, and a choice of two boards with both a Z80 and an Intel 8086, the difference being that they had either 256 KB or 512 KB RAM.

Manufacture ceased in 1986. It was superseded by the DECmate III, introduced in 1984.

DECmate III[edit]
This was introduced in 1984. It had a smaller system case, color monitor, 8 MHz clock, two 5.25-inch RX50 floppy disk drives, 32 KB user RAM, 32 KB system RAM. It was also known as the PC238.

DECmate III+[edit]
This was introduced in 1985 and withdrawn in 1990. It included a hard disk controller as part of the basic configuration. Otherwise, it was very similar to the DECmate III. It was also known as the PC24P.

The Rainbow 100 was a microcomputer introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1982. This desktop unit had the video-terminal display circuitry from the VT102, a video monitor similar to the VT220 in a dual-CPU box with both 4 MHz Zilog Z80 and 4.81 MHz Intel 8088 CPUs.[1] The Rainbow 100 was a triple-use machine: VT100 mode (industry standard dumb terminal for interacting with DEC's own VAX), 8-bit CP/M mode (using the Z80), and 16-bit CP/M-86 or MS-DOS mode using the 8088.[1][2]

Models[edit]
The Rainbow came in three models, the 100A, 100B and 100+. The "A" model was the first released, followed later by the "B" model. The most noticeable differences between the two models were the firmware and slight hardware changes. The systems were referred to with model numbers PC-100A and PC-100B respectively; later "B" models were also designated PC-100B2.

PC-100A[edit]
The "A" model was the first produced by Digital. The distinguishing characteristic of the "A" model from an end-user perspective was that the earlier firmware did not support booting from a hard disk. Other distinguishing hardware features included the three 2764 ROM chips holding the system firmware[3] and the case fan/power supply combinations.[4] Versions of the 100A shipped outside the USA included a user-changeable ROM chip in a special casing. The user changed the built-in ROM for this one to support their keyboard layout and language of the boot screen.

PC-100B[edit]
The "B" model followed the "A" model, and introduced a number of changes. The "B" model featured the ability to boot from a hard disk (referred to as the Winchester drive) via the boot menu due to updated firmware. The hardware changes included bigger firmware stored on two 27128 ROMs (16 kB)[3] and an improved case fan/power supply.[5]

The "100+" model was actually a marketing designation signifying that the system shipped with a hard drive installed; the "100+" and "B" models were identical in all other respects. When a hard-disk option was installed on the Rainbow, the kit included the 100+ emblem for the computer's case.[6]

Software[edit]
The Rainbow runs the CP/M 86/80 operating system, which detects whether software is written for 8-bit CP/M and 16-bit CP/M-86 and runs it on the appropriate processor.[15] DEC later released MS-DOS, but little DOS software was released on Rainbow media, and there were subtle differences between Rainbow's MS-DOS implementation and MS-DOS (or PC DOS) running on true IBM PC compatibles. Towards the end of its life, Rainbow users were able to run IBM PC-compatible MS-DOS software using an emulation application called Code Blue.

MS-DOS compatibility was added late in the design, so hardware interrupts and MS-DOS software interrupts overlapped. One DEC documentation pack for developers included a listing of Microsoft assembly code to handle this. The theory was that hardware interrupts would interrupt again but software interrupts would only happen once.

DEC itself ported Microsoft Windows 1.0 to the Rainbow. There was also a third-party upgrade that included a 286 processor board and a modified version of Windows 3.0.

In popular culture[edit]
The Rainbow 100 plays a small but important role in the creation of the FidoNet system. A computer club in St. Louis was in the process of setting up a BBS system using CBBS on CP/M when they learned that DEC would be giving the club a Rainbow 100 for free. The group planned on starting the BBS on this machine as soon as it arrived, but when it did so they found that the Z80 did not have access to the serial ports. Casting about for a new BBS platform that ran on DOS, they learned of FidoBBS and arranged to have its developer port the serial drivers to the Rainbow platform. This ran up considerable phone bills sending emails and file transfers between St. Louis and the developer in San Francisco, and the developer produced FidoNet as a method of automating exchanges late at night when phone rates were lower.[16]

A television advertisement for the DEC Rainbow appears in The Philadelphia Experiment.

The DEC Rainbow 100 can be seen in the 1984 film Ghostbusters. Janine uses the Rainbow at the Ghostbusters' reception.
