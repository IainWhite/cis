Google Hangouts
Google Hangouts is a communication platform developed by [Google] which includes [instant messaging], video chat, SMS and [VoIP] features. It replaces three messaging products that Google had implemented concurrently within its services, including [Google Talk], Google+ Messenger (formerly: Huddle), and Hangouts, a video chat system present within Google+. Google has also stated that Hangouts is designed to be "the future" of its telephony product, Google Voice, and integrated some of the capabilities of Google Voice into Hangouts. In current versions of [Android], Hangouts is the default application for text messaging.

Prior to the launch of Hangouts, Google had maintained several similar, but technologically separate messaging services and platforms across its suite of products. These have included the enterprise oriented Google Talk (based on [XMPP]), Google+ Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which allows for group videoconferencing with up to 10 users at once. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as [Facebook Messenger], [iMessage], and [WhatsApp]. A decision was made to scrap the existing Google Talk system and code a new messaging product through a collaboration with multiple development teams.

Following reports that the new service would be known as "Babel", the service officially launched as Hangouts during the Google I/O conference on 15 May 2013.

Daemon
In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally daemon names end with the letter d. For example, syslogd is the daemon that implements the system logging facility and sshd is a daemon that services incoming [SSH] connections.

In a [Unix] environment, the parent process of a daemon is often, but not always, the init process. A daemon is usually either created by a process forking a child process and then immediately exiting, thus causing init to adopt the child process, or by the init process directly launching the daemon. In addition, a daemon launched by forking and exiting typically must perform other operations, such as dissociating the process from any controlling terminal (tty). Such procedures are often implemented in various convenience routines such as daemon in Unix.

Systems often start daemons at boot time and serve the function of responding to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs by performing some task. Daemons can also configure hardware (like udevd on some [Linux] systems), run scheduled tasks (like [cron]), and perform a variety of other tasks.

The term was coined by the programmers of [MIT]'s Project MAC. They took the name from Maxwell's demon, an imaginary being from a thought experiment that constantly works in the background, sorting molecules. Unix systems inherited this terminology. Maxwell's Demon is consistent with Greek mythology's interpretation of a daemon as a supernatural being working in the background, with no particular bias towards good or evil. However, [BSD] and some of its derivatives have adopted a Christian demon as their mascot rather than a Greek daemon.

The word daemon is an alternative spelling of demon. Alternate terms for daemon are service ([Microsoft Windows NT]), started task (IBM z/OS), and ghost job (XDS UTS).
===

Cron
The software utility Cron is a time-based job scheduler in [Unix-like] computer operating systems. People who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration though its general purpose nature makes it useful for things like connecting to the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals. The origin of the name cron is obscure; it has been suggested that it comes from the Greek word for time, chronos, or that it is an acronym for "Command Run On Notice" or for "Commands Run Over Night".

Cron is driven by a crontab (cron table) file, a configuration file that specifies shell commands to run periodically on a given schedule. The crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron [daemon] are kept. Users can have their own individual crontab files and often there is a system wide crontab file (usually in /etc or a subdirectory of /etc) that only system administrators can edit.

Each line of a crontab file represents a job, and is composed of a CRON expression, followed by a shell command to execute. Some cron implementations, such as in the popular 4th [BSD] edition written by Paul Vixie and included in many Linux distributions, add a sixth field: an account username that runs the specified job (subject to user existence and permissions). This is allowed only in the system crontabs not in others, which are each assigned to a single user to configure. The sixth field is alternatively sometimes used for year instead of an account username the nncron daemon for Windows does this.

Google Calendar
Google Calendar is a time management web application and mobile app for created by [Google]. It became available on 13 April 2006, and exited the beta stage in July 2009. Users are required to have a Google Account in order to use the app.

The interface of Google Calendar, designed by Kevin Fox, is similar to desktop calendar applications such as [Microsoft Outlook] or [iCal] on [Mac OS X]. The [Ajax] driven interface enables users to set the number of days to show in their custom view mode.stored online; consequently, the calendar can be viewed from any location that has Internet access. For users who might experience a hard drive failure, it also means that no data is lost. The application can import Microsoft Outlook calendar files (.vcs) and , add, and drag-and-drop events from one date to another without reloading the page. It supports view modes such as weekly, monthly, and agenda. Users can "quick add" calendar events by typing standard English phrases, such as "Dinner with Michael 7 p.m. tomorrow". Users can also set the number of days to show in their custom view mode.
===

iCal
Calendar, known as iCal before the release of [OS X Mountain Lion] in July 2012. Originally released as a free download for [Mac OS X] v10.2 on 10 September 2002, it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 1.5 with the release of Mac OS X v10.3. iCal was the first calendar application for OS X to offer support for multiple calendars and the ability to intermittently publish/subscribe to calendars on WebDAV servers. Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X v10.4, Version 3 as part of Mac OS X v10.5, Version 4 as part of Mac OS X v10.6, Version 5 as part of Mac OS X v10.7, Version 6 as part of OS X v10.8, Version 7 as part of OS X v10.9, and Version 8 as part of OS X v10.10.

[Apple] licensed the iCal name from Brown Bear Software, who have used it for their iCal application since 1997.

iCal's initial development was quite different from other Apple software: it was designed independently by a small French team working "secretly" in Paris, led by Jean-Marie Hullot, a friend of [Steve Jobs]. iCal's development has since been transferred to Apple US headquarters in Cupertino.

Google Drive
Google Drive is a file storage and synchronisation service created by [Google]. It allows users to store files in the cloud, share files, and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations with collaborators. Google Drive encompasses [Google Docs], Sheets, and Slides, an office suite that permits collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more.

Google Drive was launched on 24 April 2012 and had 240 million monthly active users as of October 2014.
===

Google Docs, Sheets and Slides
Google Docs, Sheets and Slides are a word processor, a spreadsheet and a presentation program respectively, all part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by [Google] within its [Google Drive] service. The suite allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating with other users in real-time.

The three apps are available as web applications, as Chrome apps that work offline, and as mobile apps for [Android] and [iOS]. The apps are compatible with [Microsoft Office] file formats. The suite also consists of Google Forms (survey software), Google Drawings (diagramming software) and Google Fusion Tables (database manager). While Forms and Tables are only available as web applications, Drawings is also available as a Chrome app.

The suite is tightly integrated with Google Drive. All files created with the apps are by default saved to Google Drive.
===

Google Groups
Google Groups is a service from [Google Inc] that provides discussion groups for people sharing common interests. The Groups service also provides a gateway to [Usenet] newsgroups via a shared user interface.

Google Groups became operational in February 2001, following Google's acquisition of Deja's Usenet archive. (Deja News had been operational since 1995.)

Google Groups offers at least two kinds of discussion group; in both cases users can participate in threaded conversations, either through a web interface or by e-mail. The first kind are forums specific to Google Groups which are inaccessible by NNTP and act more like mailing lists. The second kind are Usenet groups, for which Google Groups acts as gateway and unofficial archive (the Google Groups archive of Usenet newsgroup postings dates back to 1981). Through the Google Groups user interface, users can read and post to Usenet groups.

In addition to accessing Google and Usenet groups, registered users can also set up mailing list archives for e-mail lists that are hosted elsewhere.
===

Google News
Google News is a free news aggregator provided and operated by [Google], selecting up to date news from thousands of publications.

A beta version was launched in September 2002, and released officially in January 2006.

Google News watches more than 4500 news sources worldwide. Versions for more than 60 regions in 28 languages are available (as of 15 March 2012). As of January 2013, service in the following languages is offered: Arabic, Cantonese, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malayalam, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

The service covers news articles appearing within the past 30 days on various news websites. In total, Google News aggregates content from more than 25,000 publishers. For the English language, it covers about 4,500 sites; for other languages, fewer. Its front page provides roughly the first 200 characters of the article and a link to its larger content. Websites may or may not require a subscription; sites requiring subscription are noted in the article description.

The layout of Google News underwent a major revision on 16 May 16, 2011.

On 14 July 2011, Google introduced "Google News Badges," which it later retired in October 2012.

Additionally in July 2011, the Sci/Tech section of the English Google News versions was split up into two sections: Science and Technology. It was announced that this section split would be performed on other language versions as well. As of early 2013, this split had not been applied to all language versions of Google News.

QWERTY
QWERTY is the most common modern-day keyboard layout for Latin script. The name comes from reading the first six keys appearing on the top left letter row of the keyboard (Q, W, E, R, T, and Y) from left to right. The QWERTY design is based on a layout created for the Sholes and Glidden typewriter and sold to Remington in 1873. It became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878, and remains in use on electronic keyboards due to inertia, the difficulty of learning a layout that differs from the currently entrenched standard, the network effect of a standard layout and the claim by some that alternatives fail to provide very significant advantages. The QWERTY keyboard has only one vowel (the letter A) on the home row, even though every English word contains a vowel, forcing the fingers to travel off the home row for most words.

Wireless Markup Language (WML)
Wireless Markup Language (WML), based on [XML], is a markup language intended for devices that implement the Wireless Application Protocol ([WAP]) specification, such as mobile phones. It provides navigational support, data input, hyperlinks, text and image presentation, and forms, much like [HTML] (HyperText Markup Language). It preceded the use of other markup languages now used with WAP, such as HTML itself, and [XHTML] (which are gaining in popularity as processing power in mobile devices increases).

Building on Openwave's [HDML], Nokia's "Tagged Text Markup Language" (TTML) and Ericsson's proprietary markup language for mobile content, the WAP Forum created the WML 1.1 standard in 1998. WML 2.0 was specified in 2001, but has not been widely adopted. It was an attempt at bridging WML and XHTML Basic before the WAP 2.0 spec was finalised. In the end, XHTML Mobile Profile became the markup language used in WAP 2.0. The newest WML version in active use is 1.3.

The first company to launch a public WML site was Dutch mobile phone network operator Telfort in October 1999 and the first company in the world to launch the Nokia 7110. The Telfort WML site was created and developed as side project to test the device's capabilities by a billing engineer called Christopher Bee and National Deployment Manager, Euan McLeod. The WML site consists of four pages in both Dutch and English that contained many grammatical errors in Dutch as the two developers were unaware the WML was configured on the Nokia 7110 as the home page and neither were native Dutch speakers.

Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP)
Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP), defines the movement of information from receiver to the sender and resembles the User Datagram Protocol in the Internet protocol suite.
The Wireless Datagram Protocol a protocol in WAP architecture, covers the Transport Layer Protocols in the Internet model. As a general transport service, WDP offers to the upper layers an invisible interface independent of the underlying network technology used. In consequence of the interface common to transport protocols, the upper layer protocols of the WAP architecture can operate independent of the underlying wireless network. By letting only the transport layer deal with physical network dependent issues, global interoperability can be acquired using mediating gateways.
===

Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS)
Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) is a security protocol, part of the Wireless Application Protocol ([WAP]) stack. It sits between the [WTP] and [WDP] layers in the WAP communications stack.

WTLS is derived from [TLS]. WTLS uses similar semantics adapted for a low bandwidth mobile device. The main changes are...

    - Compressed data structures - Where possible packet sizes are reduced by using bit-fields, discarding redundancy and truncating some cryptographic elements.
    - New certificate format - WTLS defines a compressed certificate format. This broadly follows the X.509 v3 certificate structure, but uses smaller data structures.
    - Packet based design - TLS is designed for use over a data stream. WTLS adapts that design to be more appropriate on a packet based network. A significant amount of the design is based on a requirement that it be possible to use a packet network such as SMS as a data transport.

WTLS has been superseded in the WAP Wireless Application Protocol 2.0 standard by the End-to-end Transport Layer Security Specification.

Wireless Transaction Protocol (WTP)
Wireless Transaction Protocol (WTP) is a standard used in mobile telephony. It is a layer of the Wireless Application Protocol ([WAP]) that is intended to bring Internet access to mobile phones. WTP provides functions to similar to [TCP], except that WTP has reduced amount of information needed for each transaction (e.g. does not include a provision for rearranging out-of-order packets). WTP runs on top of UDP and performs many of the same tasks as TCP but in a way optimised for wireless devices, which saves processing and memory cost as compared to TCP.

It Supports 3 types of transaction:

1    Unreliable One-Way Request
2    Reliable One-Way Request
3    Reliable Two-Way request
===

Wireless Session Protocol (WSP)
Wireless Session Protocol (WSP) is an open standard for maintaining high level session. Wireless session is nothing but a normal Web browsing session that starts when the user connects to one URL and ends when the user leaves that [URL]. By establishing the session means that the session wide properties need only to be defined once at the beginning of the session. This has the benefit of saving bandwidth due to the nature of the wireless communication. The session establishing process will not have lengthy hand shaking mechanisms.

WSP is based on HTTP 1.1 with few enhancements. WSP provides the upper-level application layer of [WAP] with a consistent interface for two session services. The first is a connection oriented service that operates above a transaction layer protocol [WTP] and the second is a connection less service that operates above a secure or non-secure datagram transport service. Therefore, WSP exists for two reasons. First, in the connection-mode it enhances the HTTP 1.1's performance over wireless environment. Second, it provides a session layer so the whole WAP environment resembles [ISO OSI Reference Model].

Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML)
The Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML) is a markup language intended for display on handheld computers, information appliances, smartphones, etc.. It is similar to [HTML], but for wireless and handheld devices with small displays, like PDA, mobile phones and so on.

It was originally developed in about 1996 by Unwired Planet, the company that became Phone.com and then Openwave. HDML was submitted to [W3C] for standardisation, but was not turned into a standard. Instead it became an important influence on the development and standardisation of [WML], which then replaced HDML in practice. (Although HDML is still in use in Japan by KDDI brands such as au, especially for mobile banking solutions.)
===

XHTML Basic
XHTML Basic is an [XML] based structured markup language primarily used for simple (mainly handheld) user agents, typically mobile devices.

XHTML Basic is a subset of XHTML 1.1, defined using [XHTML] Modularisation including a reduced set of modules for document structure, images, forms, basic tables, and object support. XHTML Basic is suitable for mobile phones, PDAs, pagers, and settop boxes.

It will replace [WML] and [C-HTML] as more compliant user agents are developed.

One large advantage XHTML Basic has over WML and C-HTML is that XHTML Basic pages can be rendered differently in web browsers and on handhelds, without the need for two different versions of the same page.

In 2006, the specification was revised to version 1.1. Six new features have been incorporated into the language in order to better serve the small device community.
===

XHTML Mobile Profile (XHTML MP)
XHTML Mobile Profile (XHTML MP) is a hypertextual computer language standard designed specifically for mobile phones and other resource constrained devices.

It is an [XHTML] document type defined by the Open Mobile Alliance. XHTML-MP is derived from [XHTML Basic] 1.0 by adding XHTML Modules, with later versions of the standard adding more modules. However, for certain modules, XHTML-MP does not mandate a complete implementation so an XHTML-MP browser may not be fully conforming on all modules.

XHTML Basic 1.1 became a [W3C] Recommendation in July 2008, superseding XHTML-MP 1.2.
===

C-HTML
C-HTML (short for Compact HyperText Markup Language), also called i-mode-HTML, is a subset of [HTML] for small information devices, such as first generation smartphones and PDAs, such as DoCoMo's i-mode mobile phones used in Japan. C-HTML adds several features not found in standard HTML, notably accesskeys, phone number shortcuts for links, and emoji pictorial characters as locally extended Shift JIS, all concepts borrowed from HDML and [WML].

Because small devices such as cellular phones have hardware restrictions such as lower memory, low-power CPUs with limited or no storage capabilities, small monochrome display screens, single-character fonts and restricted input methods (the absence of a keyboard or a mouse), there is a need for a simpler form of HTML.

C-HTML does not support tables, image maps, multiple fonts and styling of fonts, background colours and images, frames, or style sheets, and is limited to a monochromatic display.

The language is defined so that all the basic interactive operations can be done by a combination of four buttons and not by two-dimensional cursor movement: cursor forward, cursor backward, select, and back/stop. Functionality requiring two-dimensional cursor pointing, like image maps, is excluded from C-HTML.
===

Tagged Text Markup Language (TTML)
TTML was used by the [Nokia 9000 Communicator] in 1997 to enable network operators and third-party providers to offer information from the Internet to subscribers. The technology optimised Web pages for narrow-band connections by filtering out extra information such as logos and graphics.

TTML was one of the markup languages used by the WAP Forum during the creation of the [WML] 1.1 standard in 1998, which effectively made TTML itself obsolete.
