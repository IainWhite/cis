Yum - Yellowdog Updater, Modified
The Yellowdog Updater, Modified (yum) is an open-source command-line package-management utility for [Linux] operating systems using the [RPM] Package Manager. Though yum has a command-line interface, several other tools provide graphical user interfaces to yum functionality.

Yum allows automatic updates, package and dependency management, on RPM-based distributions. Like the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) from [Debian], yum works with software repositories (collections of packages), which can be accessed locally or over a network connection.

Under the hood, yum depends on RPM, which is a packaging standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digisigs to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither yum nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by endusers. Yum is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as Yum Extender (yumex) also exist. A rewrite of yum based on libsolv named DNF is currently being developed and expected to replace yum as the default package manager in Fedora 22.

RPM Package Manager 
RPM Package Manager (RPM) (originally Red Hat Package Manager; now a recursive initialism) is a package management system. The name RPM variously refers to the .rpm file format, files in this format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager itself. RPM was intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base.

Even though it was created for use in Red Hat Linux, RPM is now used in many GNU/Linux distributions. It has also been ported to some other operating systems, such as Novell NetWare (as of version 6.5 SP3) and IBM's AIX (as of version 4).

Hello, World!
A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs "Hello, World!" (or some variant thereof) on a display device. Because it is typically one of the simplest programs possible in most programming languages, it is by tradition often used to illustrate to beginners the most basic syntax of a programming language. It is also used to verify that a language or system is operating correctly.
===

Software Metric
A software metric is a quantitative measure of a degree to which a software system or process possesses some property. Since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences, there is a continuous effort by computer science practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development. The goal is obtaining objective, reproducible and quantifiable measurements, which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning, cost estimation, quality assurance testing, software debugging, software performance optimisation, and optimal personnel task assignments.

Sir Clive Marles Sinclair 
Sir Clive Marles Sinclair (born 30 July 1940) is an English entrepreneur and inventor, most commonly known for his work in consumer electronics in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

After spending several years as assistant editor of Practical Wireless and Instrument Practice, Sinclair founded Sinclair Radionics in 1961, where he produced the first slim-line electronic pocket calculator in 1972 (the Sinclair Executive). Sinclair later moved into the production of home computers and produced the [Sinclair ZX80], the UK's first mass-market home computer for less than 100GBP, and later, with [Sinclair Research], the [ZX81] and [ZX Spectrum]; the latter is widely recognised for its importance in the early days of the British home computer industry.

Knighted in 1983, Sinclair formed Sinclair Vehicles and released the Sinclair C5, a battery electric vehicle that was a commercial failure. Since then Sinclair has concentrated on personal transport, including the A-bike, a folding bicycle for commuters that weighs 5.5 kilograms (12lb) and folds down small enough to be carried on public transport.
===

Sinclair Research Ltd 
Sinclair Research Ltd is a British consumer electronics company founded by Sir [Clive Sinclair] in Cambridge. Originally incorporated in 1973 as Ablesdeal Ltd. and renamed to Westminster Mail Order Ltd and then Sinclair Instrument Ltd. in 1975, it remained dormant until 1976, when it was activated with the intention of continuing Sinclair's commercial work from his earlier company Sinclair Radionics; it adopted the name Sinclair Research in 1981.

In 1980, Clive Sinclair entered the home computer market with the [ZX80] at 99.95GBP, at the time the cheapest personal computer for sale in the UK. In 1982 the [ZX Spectrum] was released, later becoming the United Kingdom's best selling computer, competing aggressively against [Commodore] and [Amstrad].

At the height of its success, and largely inspired by the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer program, the company established the "MetaLab" research center at Milton Hall (near Cambridge), in order to pursue artificial intelligence, wafer-scale integration, formal verification and other advanced projects. The combination of the failures of the [Sinclair QL] computer and the TV80 led to financial difficulties in 1985, and a year later Sinclair sold the rights to their computer products and brand name to [Amstrad]. Sinclair Research Ltd still exists today as a one-man company, continuing to market Sir Clive Sinclair's newest inventions.

Commodore 64
The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by [Commodore International]. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units.

Volume production started in early 1982, with machines being released on to the market in August at a price of US$595. Preceded by the [Commodore VIC-20] and [Commodore PET], the C64 takes its name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM, and has technologically superior sound and graphical specifications when compared to some earlier systems such as the [Apple II] and [Atari 800], with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.

The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s. For a substantial period (1983-1986), the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year, outselling the [IBM PC compatibles], [Apple Inc] computers, and the [Atari] 8-bit family of computers. Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview, "When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years." In the UK market, the 64 faced competition from the [BBC Micro] and the [Sinclair Spectrum] but the 64 was still one of the two most-popular computers in the UK.

Part of the Commodore 64's success is because it was sold in retail stores instead of just electronics and / or computer stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs, including custom IC chips from [MOS Technology]. It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative mass-production.

Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and games. C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible video game console, to run these programs today. The C64 is also credited with popularising the computer demoscene and is still used today by some computer hobbyists. In 2008, 17 years after it was taken off the market, research showed that brand recognition for the model was still at 87%.

Commodore VIC-20
The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer which was sold by [Commodore Business Machines]. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the [PET]. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.

===

Commodore International
Commodore International was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI) along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM) participated in the development of the home personal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the [Commodore 64] (1982) and released its [Amiga] computer line in 1985.
===

Commodore Amiga
The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by [Commodore] in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model, the A1000, was launched in 1985 and became popular for its graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the [Commodore 64], and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The name "Amiga" was chosen because it is the Spanish word for (female) friend, and alphabetically it appears before [Apple] in lists of computer makers. It originated as a project code-named "Lorraine", therefore the female was used instead of the male and general version Amigo.

The best selling model, the Amiga 500, was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with approximately six million sold. The A3000, introduced in 1990, started the second generation of Amiga Systems, followed by the A500+ and the A600. Finally, as the third generation, the A1200 and the A4000 were released in 1992. However, poor marketing and failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the fourth generation game consoles, [Apple Macintosh], and [IBM PC compatibles].

Based on the [Motorola 68000] family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The original operating system, partly based on TRIPOS and written in [BCPL], is called AmigaDOS and the [GUI] is called Workbench. When it was eventually renamed AmigaOS, the BCPL parts were rewritten in the [C] language.
===

Commodore 128
The Commodore 128, also known as the C128 or occasionally CBM 128, is the last 8-bit home computer that was commercially released by [Commodore Business Machines] (CBM). Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas, it appeared three years after its predecessor, the bestselling [Commodore 64].

The C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64, with nearly full compatibility. The new machine has 128K of RAM in two 64K banks, and an 80-column color video output. It has a redesigned case and keyboard. Also included is a [Zilog Z80] CPU which allows the C128 to run [CP/M], as an alternative to the usual Commodore BASIC environment. The presence of the Z80 and the huge CP/M software library it brings, coupled with the C64's software library, gives the C128 one of the broadest ranges of available software among its competitors.

The primary hardware designer of the C128 was Bil Herd, who had worked on the Plus/4. Other hardware engineers were Dave Haynie and Frank Palaia, while the IC design work was done by Dave DiOrio. The main Commodore system software was developed by Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan, while the CP/M subsystem was developed by Von Ertwine.
===

Sinclair QL 
The Sinclair QL (for Quantum leap), is a personal computer launched by [Sinclair Research] in 1984, as an upper-end counterpart to the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum]. The QL was aimed at the serious home user and professional and executive users markets from small to large businesses and higher educational establishments, but failed to achieve commercial success.
===

Atari
The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by [Atari Inc] in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All are based on the [MOS Technology 6502] CPU running at 1.79 MHz, roughly twice that of similar designs, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the [Apple II] or [Commodore PET], and gaming on the platform was a major draw; Star Raiders is widely considered the platform's killer app. Machines with similar performance would not appear until the [BBC Micro] in late 1981 and the [Commodore 64] in 1982.

The original Atari 400 and 800 models were released with a series of plug-n-play peripherals that used Atari's unique "SIO" serial bus system. Over the following decade several versions of the same basic design were released, including the XL and XE series of computers and matching peripherals. All of these used the same basic logical design, with various changes to the physical layout to lower production costs as chipmaking and manufacturing processes improved over time. The early machines were expensive to build, but dependable. Later models like the XEs were greatly cost-reduced and generally not as robust.

The Atari 8-bit computer line sold two million units during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985, putting its sales on par with machines like the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum] and TI-99/4A. Its primary competition in the worldwide market was, starting in 1982, the [Commodore 64], which is by far the best selling computer of the 8-bit era. Atari also found a strong market in Eastern Europe and had something of a renaissance in the early 1990s as these countries joined a uniting Europe. Some estimates place sales during this period at another two million units.
===

Atari ST
The Atari ST is a line of home computers from [Atari Corporation], and the successor to the [Atari 8-bit family]. The first ST model, the 520ST, was released in June 1985. "ST" officially stands for "Sixteen/Thirty-two", which referred to the [Motorola 68000]'s 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's [GEM] released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration, and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than USD$1.

The Atari ST is part of the 16/32 bit generation of home computers, based on the Motorola 68000 CPU, typically with 512KB of RAM or more, a graphical user interface, and 3½" microfloppy disks as storage. It was similar to the [Apple Macintosh], and its simple design allowed the ST to precede the [Commodore Amiga]'s commercial release by almost two months. The ST was primarily a competitor to the [Macintosh], [Amiga], and in certain markets the [Acorn Archimedes]. Where the Amiga has a graphics accelerator and sample-based synthesis based sound, the ST has a simple frame buffer and a 3 voice synthesizer chip, but with a slightly faster CPU and a high-resolution monochrome display mode ideal for business and CAD. In some markets, particularly Germany, the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and Desktop publishing work.

Thanks to its built-in MIDI, the ST enjoyed success for running music-sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among both amateurs and well-known musicians.

The ST was later superseded by the Atari STE, Atari TT, Atari MEGA STE and Falcon computers.
===

Camputers Lynx
The Lynx was an 8-bit British home computer that was first released in early 1983 as a 48K model. Several models were available with 48K, 96K or 128K RAM. It was possible to reach 192K with RAM expansions on board. John Shireff designed the hardware and Davis Jansons the firmware.

The machine was based around a Z80A CPU clocked at 4 MHz, (6 MHz for the 128/192K models) and featured a Motorola 6845 as video controller. It was possible to run [CP/M] with the optional 5.25" floppy disk-drive on the 96K and 128K models.

The machine was quite advanced for its time. A 48K machine cost 225GBP, a 96K machine 299GBP and a 128K machine 345GBP. When compared to its competitors, such as the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum] and the Oric 1, it was also fairly highly priced. Camputers rebranded and relaunched each machine on several occasions, with the 48K machine renamed the Leisure, and the 128K machine renamed as the Laureate.

The machine had very little software available, and survived only until Camputers ceased trading in June 1984. It is believed that approximately 30,000 Camputers Lynx units were sold worldwide.

Anston Technology took over in November 1984 and a re-launch was planned but never happened. In June 1986, Anston sold everything - hardware, design rights and thousands of cassettes - to the National Lynx User Group. The group planned to produce a Super-Lynx but was too busy supplying spares and technical information to owners of existing models, and the project never came into being.

Unique features of this computer (compared to other home computers at the time) includes:

- A quite large BASIC, including graphics commands, in line CODE sentence for inclusion of machine code in hex. All numbers were floating point BCD numbers (even line numbers).
- A monitor program allowed hex dumps, copy, compare etc.
- The computer always ran in "high" resolution graphics mode (256x252 pixels in eight colours) using 6 times 10 pixels characters. Only a few bytes of graphic memory could be manipulated during the horizontal sync period[citation needed], and thus graphics were extremely slow compared to most other computers.
- Up to 192 kB of RAM and 20 kB of ROM (16 kB on the smallest model) on a 16 bit address bus was implemented using special hardware. As a consequence, certain RAM areas shadowed by ROM could only be used for data storage and the video memory had a green and alternative green bank that could be switched by a hardware register.
- For sound it had a simple (4 bit) DAC. A comparator was included to serve as an ADC (primarily used for reading from tape drives).

Compared to, for example, the [Commodore 64], the [BASIC] was more extensive and faster and resolution of graphics was better; but computer games on the other hand suffered from the special implementation and lack of hardware for sound and sprites. Thus, it was better for exploring programming or working with maths.
===

IBM PCjr 
The IBM PCjr (read "PC junior") was [IBM]'s first attempt to enter the home computer market. The PCjr, IBM model number 4860, retains the [IBM PC]'s [8088] CPU and BIOS interface for compatibility, but various design and implementation decisions led the PCjr to be a commercial failure.

Announced 1 November 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984, the PCjr nicknamed "Peanut" before its debut came in two models: the 4860-004, with 64KB of memory, priced at US$669 and the 4860-067, with 128KB of memory and a 360KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1269. It was manufactured for IBM in Lewisburg, Tennessee by Teledyne. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the IBM PC, which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard PC speaker sound and color graphics of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.

The graphics are produced by the Video Gate Array ([VGA]), an upward-compatible extension of Color Graphics Adapter ([CGA]) which adds three new graphics modes to CGA's seven. The PCjr's sound is provided by a Texas Instruments SN76489 which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a shift register. The PCjr is also the first PC compatible machine that supports page flipping for graphics operation. Since the PCjr uses system RAM to store video content and the location of this storage area can be changed, the PCjr can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are either difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.

The PCjr's 4.77 MHz [Intel 8088] CPU is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time, though the PCjr does not run at the full rated 4.77 MHz because every 4th clock cycle of the 8088 CPU is designated to refresh the PCjr's dynamic RAM as it has no dedicated memory controller; the computer's effective clockspeed is therefore 3.58 MHz. The detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's couch with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.

Ferranti
Ferranti was a UK electrical engineering and equipment firm that operated for over a century from 1885 until it went bankrupt in 1993 (the Belgian subsidiary lives on as Ferranti Computer Systems and is now part of the Nijkerk Holding). Known primarily for defence electronics, the company was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

The firm was known for work in the area of power grid systems and defence electronics. In addition, in 1951 Ferranti began selling the first commercially available computer, the [Ferranti Mark 1].

Outlook.com  / HotMail
Outlook.com is a free web-based email service run by [Microsoft]. One of the world's first webmail services, it was founded in 1996 as Hotmail (stylised as HoTMaiL) by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith in Mountain View, California, and headquartered in Sunnyvale. Hotmail was acquired by Microsoft in 1997 for an estimated $400 million and launched as MSN Hotmail, later rebranded to Windows Live Hotmail as part of the Windows Live suite of products. The last version of Hotmail was released in October 2011. As of mid-2011, Hotmail had 360 million users per month. It was available in 36 languages. In 2013, Hotmail was replaced with Outlook.com, which features Microsoft's Metro design language, and closely mimics the interface of [Microsoft Outlook]. It also features unlimited storage, [Ajax], and integration with Calendar, [OneDrive], People and [Skype].

Hotmail service was founded by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith, and was one of the first webmail services on the Internet along with Four11's RocketMail (later Yahoo! Mail). It was commercially launched on 4 July 1996, symbolising "freedom" from ISP-based email and the ability to access a user's inbox from anywhere in the world. The name "Hotmail" was chosen out of many possibilities ending in "-mail" as it included the letters HTML, the markup language used to create web pages (to emphasise this, the original type casing was "HoTMaiL"). The limit for free storage was 2M. Hotmail was initially backed by venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. By December 1997, it reported more than 8.5 million subscribers. Hotmail initially ran under [Solaris] for mail services and [Apache] on [FreeBSD] for web services, before being partly converted to [Microsoft] products, using Windows Services for UNIX in the migration path.

Hotmail was sold to Microsoft in December 1997 for a reported $400 million, and it joined the [MSN] group of services. Hotmail quickly gained in popularity as it was localised for different markets around the globe, and became the world's largest webmail service with more than 30 million active members reported by February 1999. Hotmail originally ran on a mixture of FreeBSD and Solaris operating systems. A project was started to move Hotmail to [Windows 2000]. In June 2001, Microsoft claimed this had been completed; a few days later they retracted and admitted that the DNS functions of the Hotmail system were still reliant on FreeBSD. In 2002 Hotmail still ran its infrastructure on [UNIX] servers, merely the front-end was converted to Windows 2000. Later development saw the service tied with Microsoft's web authentication scheme, Microsoft Passport (now Microsoft account), and integration with Microsoft's instant messaging and social networking programs, MSN Messenger and MSN Spaces (now Windows Live Messenger and Windows Live Spaces, respectively).

MSN - The Microsoft Network
MSN (stylised as msn) is a web portal and related collection of Internet services and apps for [Windows] and mobile devices, provided by [Microsoft] and launched on 24 August 1995, the same release date as [Windows 95].

Along with Windows 95's release, Microsoft debuted The Microsoft Network, a subscription-based dial-up online service that it later turned into an Internet service provider named MSN Dial-up. At the same time, the company launched a new web portal named Microsoft Internet Start and set it as the first default home page of [Internet Explorer], its original web browser. In 1998, Microsoft renamed and moved this web portal to the domain name MSN.com, where it has remained since then.

In addition to its original MSN Dial-up service, Microsoft has used the 'MSN' brand name for a wide variety of products and services over the years, notably [Hotmail] (which is now [Outlook.com]), Messenger (which was once synonymous with 'MSN' in Internet slang and has now been replaced by [Skype]), and its search engine (which is now [Bing]), as well as several other rebranded and discontinued services.

The current website and suite of apps offered by MSN was first introduced by Microsoft in 2014 as part of a complete redesign and relaunch. MSN is based in the United States and offers international versions of its portal for dozens of countries around the world.
===

MSDN - Microsoft Developer Network
Microsoft Developer Network, widely referred to by its abbreviation, MSDN, is the portion of [Microsoft] responsible for managing the firm's relationship with developers and testers, such as hardware developers interested in the operating system (OS), and software developers developing on the various OS platforms or using the API and/or scripting languages of Microsoft's applications. The relationship management is situated in assorted media: web sites, newsletters, developer conferences, trade media, blogs and DVD distribution. The life cycle of the relationships ranges from legacy support through evangelizing potential offerings.
