Yum - Yellowdog Updater, Modified
The Yellowdog Updater, Modified (yum) is an open-source command-line package-management utility for [Linux] operating systems using the [RPM] Package Manager. Though yum has a command-line interface, several other tools provide graphical user interfaces to yum functionality.

Yum allows automatic updates, package and dependency management, on RPM-based distributions. Like the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) from [Debian], yum works with software repositories (collections of packages), which can be accessed locally or over a network connection.

Under the hood, yum depends on RPM, which is a packaging standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digisigs to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither yum nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by endusers. Yum is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as Yum Extender (yumex) also exist. A rewrite of yum based on libsolv named DNF is currently being developed and expected to replace yum as the default package manager in Fedora 22.

RPM Package Manager 
RPM Package Manager (RPM) (originally Red Hat Package Manager; now a recursive initialism) is a package management system. The name RPM variously refers to the .rpm file format, files in this format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager itself. RPM was intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base.

Even though it was created for use in Red Hat Linux, RPM is now used in many GNU/Linux distributions. It has also been ported to some other operating systems, such as Novell NetWare (as of version 6.5 SP3) and IBM's AIX (as of version 4).

XSL - Extensible Stylesheet Language
Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) is used to refer to a family of languages used to transform and render [XML] documents.

Historically, the XSL Working Group in [W3C] produced a draft specification under the name XSL, which eventually split into three parts:

- XSL Transformation ([XSLT]): an XML language for transforming XML documents
- XSL Formatting Objects ([XSL-FO]): an XML language for specifying the visual formatting of an XML document
- XML Path Language ([XPath]): a non-XML language used by XSLT, and also available for use in non-XSLT contexts, for addressing the parts of an XML document.

As a result, the term XSL is now used with a number of different meanings:

Sometimes it refers to XSLT: this usage is best avoided. However, "xsl" is used both as the conventional namespace prefix for the XSLT namespace, and as the conventional filename suffix for files containing XSLT stylesheet modules
Sometimes it refers to XSL-FO: this usage can be justified by the fact that the XSL-FO specification carries the title Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL); however, the term XSL-FO is less likely to be misunderstood
Sometimes it refers to both languages considered together, or to the working group that develops both languages
Sometimes, especially in the [Microsoft] world, it refers to a now-obsolete variant of XSLT developed and shipped by Microsoft as part of [MSXML] before the W3C specification was finalised.

XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)
XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language for transforming [XML] documents into other XML documents, or other formats such as [HTML] for web pages, plain text or into [XSL] Formatting Objects, which may subsequently be converted to other formats, such as PDF PostScript and PNG.

The original document is not changed; rather, a new document is created based on the content of an existing one. Typically, input documents are XML files, but anything from which the processor can build an XQuery and XPath Data Model can be used, for example relational database tables, or geographical information systems.

XSLT is a Turing-complete language, meaning it can specify any computation that can be performed by a computer.
