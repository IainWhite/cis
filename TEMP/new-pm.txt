Node.js
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in [JavaScript], and can be run within the Node.js runtime on [OS X], [Microsoft Windows], [Linux], [FreeBSD], NonStop, IBM AIX, IBM System z and IBM i. Its work is hosted and supported by the Node.js Foundation, a Collaborative Project at Linux Foundation.

Node.js provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability. These technologies are commonly used for real-time web applications.

Node.js uses the [Google V8] [JavaScript engine] to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript. Node.js contains a built-in library to allow applications to act as a [Web server] without software such as [Apache HTTP Server] or [IIS].

Dojo JavaScript Toolkit
Dojo Toolkit is an open source modular [JavaScript] library (or more specifically JavaScript toolkit) designed to ease the rapid development of cross-platform, JavaScript / Ajax-based applications and web sites. It was started by Alex Russell, Dylan Schiemann, David Schontzler, and others in 2004 and is dual-licensed under the modified BSD license or the Academic Free License (≥ 2.1). The Dojo Foundation is a non-profit organisation created with the goal to promote the adoption of the toolkit.

MooTools JavaScript Framework
MooTools (My Object-Oriented Tools) is a lightweight, object-oriented, [JavaScript] framework. It is released under the free, open-source MIT License.

Valerio Proietti first authored the framework and released it in September 2006 taking as his inspiration [Prototype] and Dean Edward's [base2]. MooTools originated from Moo.fx, a popular plug-in Proietti produced for Prototype in October 2005, which is still maintained and used.

Whereas Prototype extended—prototyped—many of JavaScript's native String, Array, and Function objects with additional methods, Proietti desired a framework that (at the time) further extended the native Element object as well to offer greater control of the Document Object Model (DOM).

Components
MooTools includes a number of components, but not all need to be loaded for each application. Some of the component categories are:

- Core: A collection of utility functions that all the other components require.
- More: An official collection of add-ons that extend the Core and provide enhanced functionality.
- Class: The base library for Class object instantiation.
- Natives: A collection of JavaScript Native Object enhancements. The Natives add functionality, compatibility, and new methods that simplify coding.
- Element: Contains a large number of enhancements and compatibility standardization to the HTML Element object.
- Fx: An advanced effects-API to animate page elements.
- Request: Includes XHR interface, Cookie, JSON, and HTML retrieval-specific tools for developers to exploit.
- Window: Provides a cross-browser interface to client-specific information, such as the dimensions of the window.

Prototype JavaScript Framework 
The Prototype JavaScript Framework is a [JavaScript] framework created by Sam Stephenson in February 2005 as part of the foundation for [Ajax] support in [Ruby on Rails]. It is implemented as a single file of JavaScript code, usually named prototype.js. Prototype is distributed standalone, but also as part of larger projects, such as Ruby on Rails, [script.aculo.us] and Rico.
===

script.aculo.us
script.aculo.us is a [JavaScript] library built on the [Prototype] JavaScript Framework, providing dynamic visual effects and user interface elements via the Document Object Model (DOM).

It is most notably included with [Ruby on Rails] and Seaside, but also provided separately to work with other web application frameworks and scripting languages.

script.aculo.us was extracted by Thomas Fuchs from his work on fluxiom, a web based digital asset management tool by the design company wollzelle. It was first released to the public in June 2005.
===

YUI - Yahoo! User Interface Library
The Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI) is a discontinued open-source [JavaScript] library for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as [Ajax], [DHTML], and DOM scripting. YUI includes several core [CSS] resources. It is available under a BSD License. Development on YUI began in 2005 and [Yahoo!] properties such as My Yahoo! and the Yahoo! front page began using YUI in the summer of that year. YUI was released for public use in February 2006. It was actively developed by a core team of Yahoo! engineers.

In September 2009, Yahoo! released YUI 3, a new version of YUI rebuilt from the ground up to modernize the library and incorporate lessons learned from YUI 2. Among the enhancements are a CSS selector driven engine, like [jQuery], for retrieving DOM elements, a greater emphasis on granularity of modules, a smaller seed file that loads other modules when necessary, and a variety of syntactic changes intended to make writing code faster and easier.

The YUI Library project at Yahoo! was founded by Thomas Sha and sponsored internally by Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang; its principal architects have been Sha, Adam Moore, and Matt Sweeney. The library's developers maintain the YUIBlog; the YUI community discusses the library and implementations in its community forum.

On 29 August 2014, it was announced that active development of YUI by Yahoo! would end, citing the evolution of the JavaScript standards, steadily decreasing interest in large JavaScript libraries by developers, and the proliferation of server-side solutions. Future development will be limited to maintenance releases addressing issues which are "absolutely critical to Yahoo properties."

D3.js
D3.js (or just D3 for Data-Driven Documents) is a [JavaScript] library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualisations in [web browsers]. It makes use of the widely implemented [SVG], [HTML5], and [CSS] standards. It is the successor to the earlier Protovis framework. In contrast to many other libraries, D3.js allows great control over the final visual result. Its development was noted in 2011, as version 2.0.0 was released in August 2011.
===

SWFObject
SWFObject (originally FlashObject) is an open-source [JavaScript] library used to embed [Adobe Flash] content onto Web pages, which is supplied as one small JavaScript file. The library can also detect the installed [Adobe Flash Player] plug-in in all major web browsers, on all major operating systems (OS), and can redirect the visitor to another webpage or show alternate HTML content if the installed plug-in is not suitable.
===

AngularJS
AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular") is an open-source web application framework maintained by [Google] and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing [single-page applications]. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side [model–view–controller] (MVC) and [model-view-viewmodel] (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

The AngularJS library works by first reading the [HTML] page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard [JavaScript] variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic [JSON] resources.
===

Ext JS
Ext JS is a pure [JavaScript] application framework for building interactive web applications using techniques such as [Ajax], [DHTML] and DOM scripting.

Originally built as an add-on library extension of [YUI] by Jack Slocum, Ext JS includes interoperability with [jQuery] and [Prototype]. Beginning with version 1.1, Ext JS retains no dependencies on external libraries, instead making their use optional.
===

qooxdoo
qooxdoo is an open source [Ajax] web application framework. It is an LGPL and / or EPL licensed client-side and server-agnostic solution, and includes support for professional [JavaScript] development, a graphical user interface ([GUI]) toolkit and high-level client-server communication.

qooxdoo is entirely class-based, tries to leverage the features of object-oriented JavaScript and is based on namespaces. Most modern browsers are supported, including [Gecko] ([Firefox], Mozilla, SeaMonkey), [Presto] ([Opera]), [Trident] ([Internet Explorer], RealPlayer, Winamp), [WebKit] ([Chrome], [Safari]). It includes an API reference that is auto-generated from Javadoc-like comments. Among the accompanying tool set is a comprehensive JavaScript parser that is an integral part of the automatic build process and is used to optimize, compress, link and deploy custom applications, and generate documentation. Internationalisation and localisation of applications are supported.
===

Glow
Glow is an open-source [JavaScript] library created by the [BBC]. Development on Glow began in 2007, and it was publicly released under an Apache License in July 2009.

The rationale for the development of the library, as opposed to using other libraries such as [jQuery] or [YUI], was to meet the BBC's stated targets for cross-browser compatibility (particularly [Safari] 1.3) that are of particular use in creating a website that uses data that corresponds to times, for example broadcast metadata.
===

MochiKit
MochiKit is a light-weight [JavaScript] library written and maintained by Bob Ippolito.

Inspired by the [Python] networking framework, Twisted, it uses the concept of deferred execution to allow asynchronous behaviour. This has made it useful in the development of interactive web pages which maintain a dialog with the web server, sometimes called [Ajax] applications.

Of particular note is its ability to load and manipulate [JSON] encoded data sets, and MochiKit.DOM, a set of functions to easily create dynamic page components.

MochiKit forms the foundation of the client-side functionality of the TurboGears Python web-application stack. Perhaps as a result of the author's involvement in the Python community, MochiKit exhibits many idioms familiar to Python programmers, and is commonly used in Python-based web applications.
===

Underscore.js
Underscore.js is a [JavaScript] library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It is comparable to features provided by [Prototype.js] and the [Ruby] language, but opts for a functional programming design instead of extending object prototypes. For example, Underscore.js's _.each function delegates to the host environment's native forEach implementation when present, or a compatible version when absent. The documentation refers to Underscore.js as "the tie to go along with [jQuery]'s tux, and [Backbone.js]'s suspenders." Underscore.js was created by Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also known for Backbone.js and [CoffeeScript].
===

Backbone.js 
Backbone.js is a [JavaScript] library with a [RESTful] [JSON] interface and is based on the [model–view–presenter] (MVP) application design paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only dependency is on one JavaScript library, [Underscore.js]. It is designed for developing [single-page web applications], and for keeping various parts of web applications (e.g. multiple clients and the server) synchronised. Backbone was created by Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also known for [CoffeeScript].
===

Ember.js
Ember.js is an open-source [JavaScript] web application framework. It is based on the [model-view-controller] (MVC) software architectural pattern. It allows developers to create scalable [single-page applications] by incorporating common idioms and best practices into the framework. It provides a rich object model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, automatically-updating templates powered by HTMLBars, and a router for managing application state.
===

JavaScriptMVC
JavaScriptMVC is an open-source rich Internet application framework based on [jQuery] and [OpenAjax]. It extends those libraries with a [model–view–controller] architecture and tools for testing and deployment. As it does not depend on server components, it can be combined with any web service interface and server-side language like [ASP.NET], [Java], [Perl], [PHP], [Python], or [Ruby].
===

Knockout
Knockout is a standalone [JavaScript] implementation of the [Model-View-ViewModel] pattern with templates. The underlying principles are therefore:

- a clear separation between domain data, view components and data to be displayed
- the presence of a clearly defined layer of specialized code to manage the relationships between the view components

The latter leverages the native event management features of the JavaScript language.

These features streamline and simplify the specification of complex relationships between view components, which in turn make the display more responsive and the user experience richer.
===

Modernizr
Modernizr is a [JavaScript] library which is designed to detect [HTML5] and [CSS3] features in various browsers. Since the specifications for both HTML5 and CSS3 are only partially implemented or nonexistent in many browsers, it can be difficult to determine which techniques are available for use in rendering a page, and when it is necessary to avoid using a feature or to load a workaround such as a shim to emulate the feature. Modernizr aims to provide this feature detection in a complete and standardised manner.

===

Shim
In computer programming, a shim is a small library that transparently intercepts [API] calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation elsewhere. Shims typically come about when the behaviour of an API changes, thereby causing compatibility issues for older applications which still rely on the older functionality. In such cases, the older API can still be supported by a thin compatibility layer on top of the newer code. [Web polyfills] are a related concept. Shims can also be used for running programs on different software platforms than they were developed for.
===

HTML5Shiv
HTML5Shiv is a [JavaScript] workaround, created by Sjoerd Visscher, to enable styling of [HTML5] elements in versions of [Internet Explorer] prior to version 9, which do not allow unknown elements to be styled without [JavaScript].

Prior to version 9 of Internet Explorer there was little to no support for HTML5 elements and other HTML5 features.

Internet Explorer commands a large percentage of the usage share of web browsers. Within the Internet Explorer percentage, most of its current usage as of February 2013 comes from version 9, with version 8 holding the second-highest and version 7 the third-highest value. With its high usage percentage, it is important to ensure that web pages function correctly in Internet Explorer. HTML5Shiv allows versions of Internet Explorer prior to version 9 to recognise the HTML5 tags and allows them to be styled using CSS.
===

Web Polyfill
In web development, a polyfill (or polyfiller) is downloadable code which provides facilities that are not built into a [web browser]. It implements technology that a developer expects the browser to provide natively, providing a more uniform API landscape. For example, many features of HTML5 are not supported by versions of [Internet Explorer] older than version 8 or 9, but can be used by web pages if those pages install a polyfill. Web [shims] and HTML5 Shivs are related concepts.

The term originated with Remy Sharp who required a word that meant “replicate an API using JavaScript (or [Flash] or whatever) if the browser doesn’t have it natively” while co-writing the book 'Introducing HTML5' in 2009. Shim, to him, meant a piece of code that you could add that would fix some functionality, but it would most often have its own API, thus did not fulfil Sharp's terminology requirements. The terms progressive enhancement and graceful degradation similarly did not meet his needs since they didn't specifically require, nor were they specific to, JavaScript.

Sharp decided upon the term polyfill that can imply filling in missing browser functionality and using any number of techniques (poly can mean “many” in Greek). Polyfilla, a paste used to cover up cracks and holes in walls, was also a visualisation that Sharp found fitting for the term. He has received feedback stating that the “word should be changed”, but the term has now grown more popular amongst web developers. Sharp intentionally did not promote the term widely, only using it in specific cases and believes that it received a large amount of exposure after Paul Irish directly referenced the term in a presentation months after its inception and was helped become popular due to [Modernizr]'s “HTML5 shims & polyfill” page.

Examples

html5shiv
In IE versions prior to 9, unknown HTML elements like <section> and <nav> would be parsed as empty elements, breaking the page's nesting structure and making those elements impossible to style using CSS. One of the most widely used polyfills, html5shiv exploits another quirk of IE to work around this bug: calling document.createElement("tagname") for each of the new HTML5 elements, which causes IE to parse them correctly. It also includes basic default styling for those HTML5 elements.

-prefix-free
Though most polyfills target out-of-date browsers, some exist to simply push modern browsers forward a little bit more. Lea Verou's -prefix-free polyfill is such a polyfill, allowing current browsers to recognise the unprefixed versions of several CSS3 properties instead of requiring the developer to write out all the vendor prefixes. It reads the page's stylesheets and replaces any unprefixed properties with their prefixed counterparts recognised by the current browser.

Selectivizr
Keith Clark's Selectivizr is a popular polyfill that makes many CSS3 selectors work in IE 8 and below. It reads the page's stylesheets looking for a number of known CSS3 selectors, then uses a JavaScript selector library to query the document for elements matching those selectors, applying the styles directly to those elements. It supports several JavaScript selector libraries such as jQuery.

Flexie
Possibly one of the most anticipated features of CSS3, Flexible Box Layout (a.k.a. Flexbox) promises to be an extremely powerful tool for laying out interface elements. WebKit and Mozilla engines have supported a preliminary draft syntax for years. Flexie implements support for that same syntax in IE and Opera. However, the draft spec has undergone a drastic revision to a new (and much more powerful) syntax, which is not yet supported by Flexie. Flexie can still be used along with the old syntax, but the developer must make sure they include the new syntax for future browsers as well.

CSS3 PIE
PIE ("Progressive Internet Explorer") implements some of the most popular missing CSS3 box decoration properties in IE, including border-radius and box-shadow for IE 8 and below, and linear-gradient backgrounds for IE 9 and below. Invoked as a HTC behavior (a proprietary IE feature), it looks for the unsupported CSS3 properties on specific elements and renders those properties using VML for IE 6-8 and SVG for IE 9. Its rendering is mostly indistinguishable from native browser implementations and it handles dynamic DOM modification well.

JSON 2
Douglas Crockford originally wrote json2.js as an API for reading and writing his (then up-and-coming) JSON data format. It became so widely used that browser vendors decided to implement its API natively and turn it into a de facto standard; json2.js was transformed from a library to a polyfill after the fact.[clarification needed]

es5-shim
ECMAScript 5th Edition ("ES5") brings some useful new scripting features, and since they're syntactically compatible with older JavaScript engines they can mostly be polyfilled by patching methods onto built-in JS objects. This es5-shim polyfill does it in two parts: es5-shim.js contains those methods that can be fully polyfilled, and es5-sham.js contains partial implementations of the other methods which rely too much on the underlying engine to work accurately.

FlashCanvas
FlashCanvas is an implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API using a Flash plug-in. A rare commercial polyfill, it comes in a paid version, as well as a free version, which lacks a few advanced features like shadows.

MediaElement.js
John Dyer's MediaElement.js polyfills support for <video> and <audio> elements, including the HTML5 MediaElement API, in older browsers using Flash or Silverlight plug-ins. It also provides an optional media player UI for those elements, which is consistent across all browsers.

Webshims Lib
Alexander Farkas's Webshims Lib aggregates many other polyfills together into a single package and conditionally loads only those needed by the visiting browser.
===

Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
Object Relational Mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R Mapping) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to create their own ORM tools.

In object-oriented programming, data management tasks act on object-oriented (OO) objects that are almost always non-scalar values. For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a "Person object" with attributes/fields to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person's name, a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain "PhoneNumber objects" and so on. The address book entry is treated as a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as a method to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on.

However, many popular database products such as structured query language database management systems (SQL DBMS) can only store and manipulate scalar values such as integers and strings organized within tables. The programmer must either convert the object values into groups of simpler values for storage in the database (and convert them back upon retrieval), or only use simple scalar values within the program. Object-relational mapping is used to implement the first approach.[1]

The heart of the problem is translating the logical representation of the objects into an atomised form that is capable of being stored in the database, while preserving the properties of the objects and their relationships so that they can be reloaded as objects when needed. If this storage and retrieval functionality is implemented, the objects are said to be persistent.

Mac OS X Panther
Mac OS X Panther (version 10.3) is the fourth major release of [Mac OS X], [Apple]’s desktop and server operating system. It followed [Mac OS X 10.2] Jaguar and preceded [Mac OS X 10.4] Tiger. Apple released Panther on 24 October 2003.

Apple advertised that Mac OS X Panther had over 150 new features, including:

- Finder: Updated with a brushed-metal interface, a new live search engine, customizable Sidebar, secure deletion, File labels and Zip support built in. The Finder icon was also changed.
- Fast User Switching: Allows a user to remain logged in while another user logs in
- Exposé: Helps the user manage windows by showing them all as thumbnails.
- TextEdit: TextEdit now is also compatible with Microsoft Word (.doc) documents.
- Xcode developer tools: Faster compile times with gcc 3.3.
- Preview: Increased speed with PDF rendering
- QuickTime: Now supports the Pixlet high definition video codec
- Font Book: Font Book, Apple's font manager, simplifies viewing character maps and installing fonts. It also allows the user to sort fonts into categories.
- FileVault: On the fly encryption and decryption of a user’s home folder
- iChat AV: The new version of iChat. Now with built-in Audio- and video-conferencing.
- X11: X11 is built into Panther
- Safari: New browser made to replace Internet Explorer for Mac, developed when the contract between Apple and Microsoft ended. Internet Explorer for Mac was still available. Safari 1.0 was included in an update in Jaguar but was used as the default browser in Panther.
- Microsoft Windows interoperability improvements, including out-of-the-box support for Active Directory and SecurID-based VPNs.
- Built-in fax support.
===

Mac OS X Tiger
Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger is the fifth major release of [Mac OS X], [Apple]'s desktop and server operating system for [Mac] computers. Tiger was released to the public on 29 April 2005 for $129.95 as the successor to [Mac OS X Panther]. Some of the new features included a fast searching system called Spotlight, a new version of the [Safari] web browser, Dashboard, a new ‘Unified’ theme, and improved support for 64-bit addressing on Power Mac G5s. Tiger shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that [Microsoft] had spent several years struggling to add to [Windows] with acceptable performance.

Tiger was included with all new Macs, and was also available as an upgrade for existing Mac OS X users, or users of supported pre-Mac OS X systems. The server edition, [Mac OS X Server] 10.4, was also available for some Macintosh product lines. Six weeks after its official release, Apple had delivered 2 million copies of Tiger, representing 16% of all Mac OS X users. Apple claimed that Tiger was the most successful Apple OS release in the company's history. At the WWDC on 11 June 2007, Apple's CEO, [Steve Jobs], announced that out of the 22 million Mac OS X users, more than 67% were using Tiger.

Apple announced a transition to [Intel x86] processors during Tiger's lifetime, making it the first Apple operating system to work on Apple–Intel architecture machines. The original Apple TV, released in March 2007, shipped with a customised version of Tiger branded “Apple TV OS” that replaced the usual GUI with an updated version of Front Row.

Tiger was succeeded by [Mac OS X Leopard] on 26 October 2007, after 30 months, making Tiger the longest running version of Mac OS X. The last security update released for Tiger users was the 2009-005 update. The next security update, 2009-006 only included support for Leopard and Snow Leopard. The latest supported version of QuickTime is 7.6.4. The latest version of iTunes that can run on Tiger is 9.2.1, because 10.0 only supports Mac OS X Leopard and later. Safari 4.1.3 is the final version for Tiger as of 18 November 2010. Despite not having received security updates since then, Tiger remains popular with Power Mac users and retro computing enthusiasts due to its wide software and hardware compatibility, as it runs on a wide variety of older machines and is the last OS X version that supports Classic Environment, a [Mac OS 9] compatibility layer.

Apple advertises that Tiger has over 150 new and improved features, including:

- Spotlight — Spotlight is a full-text and metadata search engine, which can search everything on one's Mac including Microsoft Word documents, iCal calendars and Address Book contact cards. The feature is also used to build the concept of ‘smart folders’ into the Finder. Spotlight will index files as they are saved, so they can be quickly and easily found through a search-as-you-type box in the menu bar. As a side-effect, it adds hidden folders and indexing files to removable media like USB flash drives.
- iChat AV — The new iChat AV 3.0 in Tiger supports up to four participants in a video conference and ten participants in an audio conference. It also now supports communication using the XMPP protocol. A XMPP server called iChat Server is included on Mac OS X Tiger Server.
- Safari RSS — The new Safari 2.0 web browser in Tiger features a built-in reader for RSS and Atom web syndication that can be accessed easily from an RSS button in the address bar of the web browser window. An updated version of Safari, included as part of the free Mac OS X v.10.4.3 update, can also pass the Acid2 web standards test.
- Mail 2 — The new version of Mail.app email client included in Tiger featured an updated interface, "Smart Mailboxes" which utilize the Spotlight search system, parental controls, as well as several other features.
- Dashboard — The Dashboard is a new mini-applications layer based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which returns the desk accessories concept to the Mac OS. These accessories are known as widgets. It comes with several widgets such as Weather, World Clock, Unit Converter, and Dictionary/Thesaurus. More are available for free online. Its similarity to the Konfabulator application caused some criticism.[18]
- Automator — A scripting tool to link applications together to form complex automated workflows (written in AppleScript, Cocoa, or both). Automator comes with a complete library of actions for several applications that can be used together to make a Workflow.
- VoiceOver — accessibility interface that offers the user magnification options, keyboard control and spoken English descriptions of what is happening on screen. VoiceOver enables users with visual impairment the ability to use applications via spoken commands. It also allows a user to work collaboratively with other users on a single Mac by allowing multiple users give voice commands to scroll text, etc. VoiceOver is capable of reading aloud the contents of files including web pages, mail messages and word processing files. The complete keyboard navigation lets the user control the computer with the keyboard rather than mouse, a menu is displayed in a window showing all the available keyboard commands that can be used.
- A complete built-in Dictionary/Thesaurus based on the New Oxford American Dictionary, Second Edition, accessible through an application, Dictionary, a Dashboard widget, and as a system-wide command (see below).
- .Mac syncing — Though this is not a new feature, .Mac syncing in Tiger is much improved over Panther. Syncing tasks in Tiger are now accomplished through the .Mac system preferences pane rather than the iSync application.
- QuickTime 7 — A new version of Apple's multimedia software has support for the new H.264/AVC codec which offers better quality and scalability than other video codecs.[citation needed] This new codec is used by iChat AV for clearer video conferencing. New classes within Cocoa provide full access to QuickTime for Cocoa application developers. The new QuickTime 7 player application bundled with Tiger now includes more advanced audio and video controls as well as a more detailed Information dialog, and the new player has been rebuilt using Apple's Cocoa API to take advantage of the new technologies more easily.
- New Unix features — New versions of cp, mv, and rsync which support files with resource forks. Command-line support for features like the above-mentioned Spotlight are also included.
- Xcode 2.0 — Xcode 2.0, Apple's Cocoa development tool now includes visual modelling, an integrated Apple Reference Library and graphical remote debugging.
- Automator — Automator uses workflows to process repetitive tasks automatically
- Grapher — Grapher is a new application capable of creating 2D and 3D graphs similar to that of Graphing Calculator.
- Dictionary — A dictionary and thesaurus program which uses the New Oxford American Dictionary. It has a fast GUI for displaying the Dictionary, and allows the user to search the dictionary with Spotlight, to print definitions, and to copy and paste text into documents. Dictionary also provides a Dictionary service in the Application menu, and Cocoa and WebKit provides a global keyboard shortcut (ctrl-⌘-D by default) for all applications that display text with them. Its use was furthered in the next version of OS X by providing definitions from Wikipedia. The Dictionary application is a more feature-filled version of the Dictionary widget.
- Quartz Composer — Quartz Composer is a development tool for processing and rendering graphical data.
- AU Lab — AU Lab is a developer application for testing and mixing Audio Units.

Mac OS X Leopard
Mac OS X Leopard (version 10.5) is the sixth major release of [Mac OS X], [Apple]'s desktop and server operating system for [Macintosh] computers. Leopard was released on 26 October 2007 as the successor of [Mac OS X Tiger] (version 10.4), and is available in two editions: a desktop version suitable for personal computers, and a server version, [Mac OS X Server]. It retailed for $129 for the desktop version and $499 for Server. Leopard was superseded by [OS X Snow Leopard] (version 10.6). Leopard is the final version of Mac OS X to support the [PowerPC] architecture as Snow Leopard functions solely on [Intel] based Macs.

According to Apple, Leopard contains over 300 changes and enhancements over its predecessor, [Mac OS X Tiger], covering core operating system components as well as included applications and developer tools. Leopard introduces a significantly revised desktop, with a redesigned Dock, Stacks, a semitransparent menu bar, and an updated Finder that incorporates the Cover Flow visual navigation interface first seen in iTunes. Other notable features include support for writing 64-bit graphical user interface applications, an automated backup utility called Time Machine, support for Spotlight searches across multiple machines, and the inclusion of Front Row and Photo Booth, which were previously included with only some Mac models.

Apple missed Leopard's release time frame as originally announced by Apple's CEO [Steve Jobs]. When first discussed in June 2005, Jobs had stated that Apple intended to release Leopard at the end of 2006 or early 2007. A year later, this was amended to Spring 2007 however on 12 April 2007, Apple issued a statement that its release would be delayed until October 2007 because of the development of the [iPhone].

Apple advertised that Mac OS X Leopard has 300+ new features, including:

- A new and improved Automator, with easy starting points to easily start a workflow. It also can quickly create or edit workflows with new interface improvements. Now it can use a new action called "Watch Me Do" that lets you record a user action (like pressing a button or controlling an application without built-in Automator support) and replay as an action in a workflow. It can create more useful Automator workflows with actions for RSS feeds, iSight camera video snapshots, PDF manipulation, and much more.
- Back to My Mac, a feature for MobileMe users that allows users to access files on their home computer while away from home via the internet.
- Boot Camp, a software assistant allowing for the installation of other operating systems, such as Windows XP (SP2 or later) or Windows Vista, on a separate partition (or separate internal drive) on Intel-based Macs.
- Dashboard enhancements, including Web Clip, a feature that allows users to turn a part of any Web page displayed in Safari into a live Dashboard widget, and Dashcode to help developers code widgets.[13]
- New Desktop, comprises a redesigned 3-D dock with a new grouping feature called Stacks, which displays files in either a "fan" style, "grid" style, or (since 10.5.2) a "list" style. R.L. Prior, on the ThinkMac blog, criticized the shelf-like Dock along with a number of other changes to the user interface.[14]
- Dictionary can now search Wikipedia, and a dictionary of Apple terminology as well. Also included is the Japanese-language dictionary Daijisen, Progressive E-J and Progressive J-E dictionaries, and the 25,000-word thesaurus Tsukaikata no Wakaru Ruigo Reikai Jiten (使い方の分かる類語例解辞典?), all of which are provided by the Japanese publisher Shogakukan.[15][16]
- A redesigned Finder, with features similar to those seen in iTunes 7, including Cover Flow and a Source list-like sidebar.
- Front Row has been reworked to closely resemble the interface of the original Apple TV.
- iCal calendar sharing and group scheduling as well as syncing event invitations from Mail.[17] The icon also reflects the current date even when the application is not running. In previous versions of Mac OS X, the icon would show July 17 in the icon any time the application was not running but the current date when the application was running.
- iChat enhancements, including multiple logins, invisibility, animated icons, and tabbed chats, similar to features present in Pidgin, Adium and the iChat plugin Chax; iChat Theater, allowing users to incorporate images from iPhoto, presentations from Keynote, videos from QuickTime, and other Quick Look features into video chats; and Backdrops, which are similar to chroma keys, but use a real-time difference matte technique which does not require a green or blue screen. iChat also implements screen sharing, a feature previously available with Apple Remote Desktop.[10][18][19]
- Mail enhancements including the additions of RSS feeds, Stationery, Notes, and to-dos. To-dos use a system-wide service that is available to all applications.[20]
- Network file sharing improvements include more granular control over permissions, consolidation of AFP, FTP and SMB sharing into one control panel, and the ability to share individual folders, a feature that had not been available since Mac OS 9.[21]
- Parental controls now include the ability to place restrictions on use of the Internet and to set parental controls from anywhere using remote setup.[22]
- Photo Booth enhancements, including video recording with real-time filters and blue/green-screen technology.
- Podcast Capture, an application allowing users to record and distribute podcasts. It requires access to a computer running Mac OS X Server with Podcast Producer.
- Preview adds support for annotation, graphics, extraction, search, markup, Instant Alpha and size adjustment tools.[23]
- Quick Look, a framework allowing documents to be viewed without opening them in an external application and can preview it in full screen.[24] Plug-ins are available for Quick Look so that you can also view other files, such as Installer Packages.
- Safari 3, which includes Web Clip.
- Spaces, an implementation of virtual desktops (individually called "Spaces"), allows multiple desktops per user, with certain applications and windows in each desktop.[25] Users can organize certain Spaces for certain applications (e.g., one for work-related tasks and one for entertainment) and switch between them. Exposé works inside Spaces, allowing the user to see at a glance all desktops on one screen.[26]) Users can create and control up to 16 spaces, and applications can be switched between each one, creating a very large workspace. The auto-switching feature in Spaces has annoyed some of its users. Apple added a new preference in 10.5.2 which disabled this feature, but there were still bugs found while switching windows. In 10.5.3, this problem was addressed and was no longer an issue.[27]
- Spotlight incorporates additional search capabilities such as Boolean operators, as well as the ability to search other computers (with permissions).[28]
- Time Machine, an automated backup utility which allows the user to restore files that have been deleted or replaced by another version of a file.[29] Though generally lauded in the press as a step forward for data recovery, Time Machine has been criticized in multiple publications for lacking the capabilities of third-party backup software. Analyzing the feature for TidBITS, Joe Kissell pointed out that Time Machine does not create bootable copies of backed-up volumes, does not back up to AirPort Disk hard drives and will not back up FileVault encrypted home directories until the user logs out, concluding that the feature is "pretty good at what it does" but he will only use it as part of a "broader backup strategy".[30][31][32] One of these issues has been resolved, however; On March 19, 2008, updates were released for AirPort and Time Machine, allowing for Time Machine to use a USB hard disk which has been connected to an AirPort Extreme Base Station.[33]
- Universal Access enhancements: significant improvements to applications including VoiceOver, along with increased support for Braille, closed captioning and a new high‐quality Speech synthesis voice.[34]
- Many changes to the user interface, such as a transparent menu bar, new icons, and a 3D Dock. As well as this, the Apple icon is now black instead of blue. R.L. Prior, on the ThinkMac blog, criticized a number of changes to Leopard's user interface, including the transparent menu bar and the new folder icons.[14] Decreased transparency of the menu bar, along with the ability to disable the menu bar transparency were added with the 10.5.2 release on February 11, 2008.[35]
- Russian language support, bringing the total to 18 languages.[36]
- Leopard removes support for Classic applications.[37]
- Introduced the Alex voice to VoiceOver. It is the most natural and understandable voice yet, says Apple.[38]

Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6) is the seventh major release of [Mac OS X], [Apple]'s desktop and server operating system for [Macintosh] computers.

Snow Leopard was publicly unveiled on 8 June 2009 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. On 28 August 2009, it was released worldwide, and was made available for purchase from Apple's website and its retail stores at the price of US$29 for a single-user license. As a result of the low price, initial sales of Snow Leopard were significantly higher than that of its predecessors. The release of Snow Leopard came nearly two years after the introduction of [Mac OS X Leopard], the second longest time span between successive Mac OS X releases (the time span between Tiger and Leopard was the longest).

Unlike those of previous versions of Mac OS X, the goals of Snow Leopard were improved performance, greater efficiency and the reduction of its overall memory footprint. Addition of new end-user features was not a primary consideration: its name was intended to signify its goal to be a refinement of the previous OS X version, Leopard. Much of the software in Mac OS X was extensively rewritten for this release in order to take advantage fully of modern Macintosh hardware. New programming frameworks, such as OpenCL, were created, allowing software developers to use graphics cards in their applications. This is also the first Mac OS release since System 7.1.1 that does not support Macs using PowerPC processors, as Apple now intends to focus on its current line of Intel-based products. As support for Rosetta was dropped in OS X Lion, Snow Leopard is the last version of Mac OS X that is able to run [PowerPC] only applications.

Snow Leopard was succeeded by [Mac OS X Lion] (version 10.7) on 20 July 2011. Since then, Apple has continued to sell Snow Leopard from its online store for the benefit of users that require Snow Leopard in order to upgrade to later versions of OS X, which have all been distributed through the Mac App Store introduced in the Snow Leopard 10.6.6 update.

Snow Leopard is the last release of Mac OS X to support the 32-bit Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo CPUs.

Mac OS X Snow Leopard is intended to be a release aimed to refine the existing feature set, expand the technological capabilities of the operating system, and improve application efficiency. Many of the changes involve how the system works in the background and are not intended to be seen by the user. For example, the Finder application was completely rewritten in the [Cocoa] application programming interface. Despite significant changes in the software, users will experience almost no changes in the user interface. Snow Leopard includes the following changes:

- Boot Camp now allows Windows partitions to read and copy files from HFS+ partitions. The new version also adds support for advanced features on Cinema Displays and a new command-line version of the Startup Disk Control Panel.
- The Finder has been completely rewritten in Cocoa to take advantage of the new technologies introduced in Snow Leopard.
- A much smaller OS footprint, taking up about 7 GB less space than Mac OS X Leopard. Some of the recovered disk space (~250 MB) is because printer drivers are now downloaded or installed only as needed, rather than being pre-installed. The default install only contains those drivers needed for existing printers and a small subset of popular printers.[16]
- iChat enhancements include greater resolution video chats in iChat Theater and lowered upload bandwidth requirements.
- Microsoft Exchange support is now integrated into the Mail, Address Book, and iCal applications. However, only Microsoft Exchange 2007 is supported and customers using prior versions of Exchange must either upgrade or use Microsoft Entourage.
- Full multi-touch trackpad support has been added to notebooks prior to those introduced in October 2008. While the original MacBook Air and other early multi-touch trackpad enabled notebooks had support for some gestures, they were unable to use four-finger gestures. This limitation has now been removed in Snow Leopard.
- Preview can infer the structure of a paragraph in a PDF document.
- QuickTime X, the next version of QuickTime player and multimedia framework, has been completely rewritten into a full 64-bit Cocoa application and builds on the media technologies in Mac OS X, such as Core Audio, Core Video, and Core Animation, to deliver playback. Apple has redesigned the QuickTime user interface to resemble the full-screen QuickTime view in prior versions, where the entire window displays the video. The titlebar and playback controls fade in and out as needed. QuickTime X also supports HTTP live streaming and takes advantage of ColorSync to provide high-quality color reproduction.[18] If Snow Leopard is installed on a Mac with an nVidia GeForce 9400M, 320M or GT 330M graphics card, QuickTime X will be able to use its video-decoding capabilities to reduce CPU load.
- Safari 4 features Top Sites, Cover Flow, VoiceOver, expanded standards support, and built-in crash resistance, which prevents browser crashes caused by plug-ins by running them in separate processes.[19] Safari 4 is bundled with Snow Leopard but does not require it, as it is available for free for Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard as well as Windows.
- Time Machine connection establishment and backups are now much faster.
- VoiceOver has also been greatly enhanced in Snow Leopard. Reading of web pages is improved with Auto Web Spots — areas of a page automatically designated for quick access. On newer Apple portables, trackpad gestures can be used to control VoiceOver functions, including the "rotor" gesture first seen in VoiceOver for the iPhone 3GS, allowing for the changing of certain VoiceOver navigation options by rotating fingers on the trackpad. Braille Display support is also improved, with Bluetooth displays supported for the first time.[20]

The 10.6.6 update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for OS X applications.

Mac OS X Lion

Mac OS X Lion (version 10.7; marketed as OS X Lion) is the eighth major release of [Mac OS X], [Apple]'s desktop and server operating system for [Macintosh] computers.

A preview of Lion was publicly unveiled at the "Back to the Mac" Apple Special Event on 20 October 2010. It brings many developments made in Apple's [iOS], such as an easily navigable display of installed applications, to the Mac, and includes support for the Mac App Store, as introduced in [Mac OS X Snow Leopard] version 10.6.6. On 24 February 2011, the first developer's preview of Lion (11A390) was released to subscribers to the Apple Developer program. Other developer previews were subsequently released, with Lion Preview 4 (11A480b) being released at WWDC 2011.

Lion was released to manufacturing on 1 July 2011, followed by its final release via the Mac App Store on 20 July 2011. Apple reported over one million Lion sales on the first day of its release. As of October 2011, Mac OS X Lion has sold over six million copies worldwide.

Some new features were announced at the "Back to the Mac" keynote in October 2010, and the Apple website was updated in February 2011, with more details. Other features were announced at the WWDC 2011 keynote or on Apple's Mac OS X Lion Web site after the keynote. Apple states that there are over 250 new or changed features in Lion, including:

- Address Book uses an iPad-like user interface. It also includes improved Yahoo support and FaceTime calling.
- AirDrop – Lion-to-Lion direct file sharing via Wi-Fi Direct. No wireless access point required.
- Address space layout randomization – Address space layout randomization (ASLR), a security technique that puts important data in unpredictable locations, making it harder to target known weaknesses, is available for 32-bit applications, and "has been improved for all applications", in Lion.
- Apple Push Notification Service – Send over-the-air alerts, such as news updates or social networking status changes, using Apple's Push Notification service to applications that support APNS. APNS allows Mac OS X Lion and iOS clients to receive push changes to items such as mail, calendar and contacts from a configured OS X Lion Server.
- Auto-correction behaves much like on iOS devices, displaying an iOS-like popup box.
- Auto Save – As in iOS, documents in applications written to use Auto Save are saved automatically so users do not have to worry about manually managing their documents. The Auto Save feature significantly alters traditional workflow patterns and is a controversial addition to the system.
- Emoji support – Apple has added a new Emoji font commonly used in chat to express ideograms.
- Exposé in the Dock, a way of activating Exposé for a single application from the Dock, a feature added in Mac OS X 10.6, is altered. One must double-tap with two fingers on a dock icon to initiate single application exposé, or simply right-click or control-click and select Show All Windows.
- FaceTime comes bundled with Lion.
- FileVault offers full disk encryption and added security with XTS-AES 128 data encryption. Support for FileVault on external hard drives has also been added.
- Finder improvements – Finder search allows multiple search criteria to be specified without creating a smart folder, Finder search offers suggestions, files can be grouped by various attributes, and one can merge files under two folders with the same name – a prompt appears asking to replace or keep both files.[33][34] The navigation sidebar lost the ability to show the specific icon of a map[vague] or volume (by default; there is a hack to still add the old ability), instead it shows a grey standard map icon.
- Font Book 3—Font Book 3 provides more flexible displays of character glyphs supplied by a particular font face. Duplicate font files are flagged with a warning icon, and can be fixed automatically or resolved manually.
- Full-screen apps – Native, system-wide support for full-screen applications running in their own space. Supporting applications display a new button at the top right of application window, this button opens applications in full-screen mode. However, full screen mode is not supported for dual screen setups.
- High-quality multilingual speech voices – users can download new high-quality voices in more than forty languages and dialects.
- iCal has an updated user interface, an annual view, and support for a full-screen view.
- iChat has support for logging into Yahoo! Messenger. Users can audio- and video-chat with other iChat users using their Yahoo! accounts.
- Languages/Localization – Arabic, Czech, Turkish and Hungarian are added as full system languages, to make the total number of twenty-two languages available in Mac OS X.
- Launchpad – An application launcher that displays an iOS-like icon grid of installed applications. It features the ability to make multiple pages and group apps into folders that function the same as folders in iOS.
- Mac App Store – An application store built in the image of the iOS App Store. Like in iOS, it provides ways for shoppers to discover apps, one-click installation of apps, and one-click updates of all or selected installed applications.[5][44][45] Despite being announced as a future feature of Lion, the Mac App Store was released for Mac OS X Snow Leopard on January 6, 2011, as it was bundled with the Mac OS X 10.6.6 update.
- Mail 5 – Uses an iPad-like user interface, has a fullscreen-optimized view, uses chronological "Conversations" to organize messages,[47] and supports Exchange 2010 (but not through the Exchange ActiveSync protocol, as iOS).
- Mission Control replaces the "All windows" Exposé feature. It gives an overview of all running applications just like "All windows" but groups windows from the same application. At the top of the screen it gives quick access to the Dashboard, Spaces, and running full-screen applications.[5][49]
- Multi-touch gestures – Similar to iOS, additional gestures performed using a multi-touch input device (e.g. Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad) allow the user to scroll, swipe to different pages, and enter Mission Control.[50] While this is not the first official multi-touch support for Mac OS X, it has been expanded; other frameworks, such as Lux,[51] have already created multi-touch support.
- Multi-User Screen Sharing—The built-in Screen Sharing feature allows remote users to log into a separate user account from the one that is currently logged in. That means that while one user is logged into a machine, a second user can log into the same machine remotely, seeing their own desktop and user environment.[52][53]
- Preview gains several features, including full-screen support and the ability to sign a document just by holding a signed piece of paper up to the camera.
- Profile Manager provides several features, including push notification-based management of OS X Lion and above.
- QuickTime re-incorporates some features from QuickTime Pro. New features cited include Copy/Paste, Insert Clip, Crop Video, Rotate Video, Resize, Trim, and more Export options.
- Recovery Partition – Apple has introduced a recovery partition that includes utilities generally found on the OS X discs. This partition permits the user to restore their computer to its original factory state. It also allows for a new copy of OS X Lion to be installed over the internet.
- Resume – Applications resume in the same state when re-opened as already seen in iOS.
- Safari – With full-screen mode and the new WebKit2 layout engine.
- System Information – This feature is a re-design of System Profiler, which has been completely altered with new views which display graphical information on displays, storage devices, memory usage along with other hardware information. The previous layout remains available by clicking "System Report". Early builds of Lion also used System Information as a replacement for "About This Mac",[62] although the final release reinstated the version of this dialog box found in Snow Leopard.
- Terminal has extra features, including full screen mode.
- TextEdit gains a new graphical toolbar with font selection and text highlighting. The new TextEdit also supports Apple's new automatic file saving and versions technologies.[63][64]
- Versions – Time Machine-like saving and browsing of past versions of documents for applications written to use Versions.
- Vertical text – Lion supports vertical layouts for East Asian languages.

OS X Mountain Lion
OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8) is the ninth major release of [OS X] (formerly Mac OS X), [Apple Inc]'s desktop and server operating system for [Macintosh] computers. OS X Mountain Lion was released on 25 July 2012 for purchase and download through Apple's Mac App Store, as part of a switch to releasing OS X versions online and every year. Named to signify its status as a refinement of the previous OS X version, Lion, Apple's stated aims in developing Mountain Lion were to allow users to more easily manage and synchronise content between multiple Apple devices and to make the operating system more familiar.

The operating system gained the new malware-blocking system Gatekeeper and integration with Apple's online Game Center and iCloud services, while the [Safari] web browser was updated to version 6. As on [iOS], Notes and Reminders became full applications, separate from Mail and Calendar, while the iChat application was replaced with a version of iOS's Messages. Mountain Lion also added a version of iOS's Notification Center, which groups updates from different applications in one place. Integrated links allowing the user to rapidly transfer content to Twitter were present in the operating system from launch. Facebook integration was also planned but unfinished at launch date. It was released as a downloadable update later.

OS X Mountain Lion received positive reviews, with critics praising Notification Center, Messages, and speed improvements over Mac OS X Lion, while criticising iCloud for unreliability and Game Center for lack of games. Mountain Lion sold three million units in the first four days, and has sold 28 million units as of 10 June 2013, making it Apple's most popular OS X release.

OS X Mavericks
OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) is the tenth major release of [OS X], [Apple Inc]'s desktop and server operating system for [Macintosh] computers. OS X Mavericks was announced on 10 June 2013, at WWDC 2013, and was released on 22 October 2013, as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide.

The update places emphasis on battery life, Finder enhancements, other enhancements for power users, and continued iCloud integration, as well as bringing more of Apple's iOS apps to the OS X platform. Mavericks marks the beginning of a change in the naming scheme of OS X, departing from the use of big cats and moving to names based on places in California; OS X Mavericks is named after the surfing location in California.

The following is a list of features that differ from previous releases of OS X:

- Improved multiple display support: The menu bar and the Dock are available on each display; Apple TV can be used as an external display.
- Mission Control has been updated to organize and switch between Desktop workspaces independently between multiple displays.
- Finder enhancements, including tabs,[8] fullscreen support, and document tags.[8] Pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-navigate-history gestures have been removed, although both are supported anywhere else.
- New iBooks application.
- New Maps application.
- Calendar enhancements.
- Safari browser enhancements.
- iCloud Keychain sync.
- Notification Center enhancements.
- Some skeuomorphs, such as the leather texture in Calendar, the legal pad theme of Notes, and the book-like appearance of Contacts, have been removed from the UI.
- Timer coalescing, which enhances energy efficiency by reducing CPU usage by up to 72 percent.
- App Nap, which sleeps apps that are not currently visible.
- Compressed Memory, a virtual memory compression system which automatically compresses data from inactive apps when approaching maximum memory capacity.
- Server Message Block version 2 (SMB2) is now the default protocol for sharing files.
- LinkedIn sharing integration.
- OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile.
- OpenCL 1.2.
- USB syncing of calendar, contacts and other information to iOS devices has been removed, instead requiring the use of iCloud.
- Some system alerts, such as low battery and removal of drives without ejecting, have been moved to Notification Center.
- The Open Transport API has been removed.
- Quicktime 10 does not support many older video codecs and converts them to the ProRes format when opened. Older video codecs cannot be viewed in Quick Look.
- Improved Privacy: Safari now supports browsing in private browsing mode with certain windows (as opposed to all the windows having to be either in or out of private browsing).
- The "traffic light" close, minimize, and maximize window buttons have appeared somewhat brighter.

OS X Yosemite
OS X Yosemite (version 10.10) is the eleventh major release of [OS X], [Apple Inc]'s desktop and server operating system for [Macintosh] computers.

OS X Yosemite was announced and released to developers on 2 June 2014 at WWDC 2014 and released to public beta testers on 24 July 2014. Yosemite was released to consumers on 16 October 2014. Following the California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with [OS X Mavericks], Yosemite is named after the national park.
