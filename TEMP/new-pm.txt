Vector Graphics
Vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygons all of which are based on mathematical expressions to represent images in computer graphics. Vector graphics are based on vectors (also called paths), which lead through locations called control points or nodes. Each of these points has a definite position on the x and y axes of the work plane and determines the direction of the path; further, each path may be assigned a stroke color, shape, thickness, and fill. These properties don't increase the size of vector graphics files in a substantial manner, as all information resides in the document's structure, which describes solely how the vector should be drawn. Vector graphics can be magnified infinitely without loss of quality, while pixel-based graphics cannot.

The term vector graphics is typically used only for 2D (planar) graphics objects, in order to distinguish them from 2D raster graphics, which are also very common. 3D graphics as commonly implemented today (e.g., in OpenGL) are typically described using primitives like 3D points and polygons connecting these (which in turn describe surfaces); these 3D primitives are much more similar to vector graphics than to raster graphics, but aren't explicitly called vector graphics. The equivalent of raster graphics in the 3D world are voxel-based graphics.

RTF - Rich Text Format
The Rich Text Format (often abbreviated RTF) is a proprietary document file format with published specification developed by [Microsoft Corporation] from 1987 until 2008 for cross-platform document interchange with Microsoft products.

Most word processors are able to read and write some versions of RTF. There are several different revisions of RTF specification and portability of files will depend on what version of RTF is being used. RTF specifications were changed and published with major [Microsoft Word] and [Office] versions.

It should not be confused with [enriched text] (mimetype "text/enriched" of [RFC 1896]) or its predecessor Rich Text (mimetype "text/richtext" of [RFC 1341] and [1521]); nor with [IBM]'s [RFT-DCA] (Revisable Format Text-Document Content Architecture) which are completely different specifications.

Raster Graphics
In computer graphics, a raster graphics image is a dot matrix data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels, or points of color, viewable via a monitor, paper, or other display medium. Raster images are stored in image files with varying format.

A bitmap, a single-bit raster, corresponds bit-for-bit with an image displayed on a screen, generally in the same format used for storage in the display's video memory, or maybe as a device-independent bitmap. A raster is technically characterised by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel (a colour depth, which determines the number of colours it can represent).

The printing and prepress industries know raster graphics as contones (from "continuous tones"). The opposite to contones is "line work", usually implemented as vector graphics in digital systems.

PNG - Portable Network Graphics
Portable Network Graphics (PNG) is a [raster graphics] file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG was created as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format ([GIF]), and is the most used lossless image compression format on the [Internet].

PNG supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit [RGB] or 32-bit [RGBA] colors), grayscale images (with or without alpha channel), and full-color non-palette-based RGB(A) images (with or without alpha channel). PNG was designed for transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics, and therefore does not support non-RGB color spaces such as [CMYK].

PNG files nearly always use file extension PNG or png and are assigned [MIME media type] image/png. PNG was approved for this use by the Internet Engineering Steering Group on 14 October 1996,[5] and was published as an ISO/IEC standard in 2004.

GIF - Graphics Interchange Format
The Graphics Interchange Format (better known by its acronym GIF) is a [bitmap image format] that was introduced by [CompuServe] in 1987 and has since come into widespread usage on the [World Wide Web] due to its wide support and portability.

The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colours chosen from the 24-bit [RGB] color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colours for each frame. These palette limitations make the GIF format less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with continuous colour, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of colour.

GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. This compression technique was patented in 1985. Controversy over the licensing agreement between the software patent holder, Unisys, and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the Portable Network Graphics ([PNG]) standard. By 2004 all the relevant patents had expired.

JPEG
In computing, JPEG (seen most often with the .jpg or .jpeg filename extension) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.

JPEG compression is used in a number of image file formats. JPEG/[Exif] is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices; along with JPEG/[JFIF], it is the most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on the [World Wide Web]. These format variations are often not distinguished, and are simply called JPEG.

The term "JPEG" is an acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, which created the standard. The MIME media type for JPEG is image/jpeg (defined in [RFC 1341]), except in older [Internet Explorer] versions, which provides a MIME type of image/pjpeg when uploading JPEG images.

JPEG/JFIF supports a maximum image size of 65535×65535 pixels, hence up to 4 gigapixels (for an aspect ratio of 1:1).

Exif - Exchangeable Image File Format
Exchangeable image file format (officially Exif, according to JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA specifications) is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. The specification uses the following existing file formats with the addition of specific metadata tags: [JPEG] discrete cosine transform (DCT) for compressed image files, TIFF Rev. 6.0 (RGB or YCbCr) for uncompressed image files, and RIFF WAV for audio files (Linear PCM or ITU-T G.711 μ-Law PCM for uncompressed audio data, and IMA-ADPCM for compressed audio data).

This standard consists of the Exif image file specification and the Exif audio file specification.

Bitmap
In computing, a bitmap is a mapping from some domain (for example, a range of integers) to bits, that is, values which are zero or one. It is also called a bit array or bitmap index.

In computer graphics, when the domain is a rectangle (indexed by two coordinates) a bitmap gives a way to store a binary image, that is, an image in which each pixel is either black or white (or any two colours).

The more general term pixmap refers to a map of pixels, where each one may store more than two colors, thus using more than one bit per pixel. Often bitmap is used for this as well. In some contexts, the term bitmap implies one bit per pixel, while pixmap is used for images with multiple bits per pixel.

A bitmap is a type of memory organisation or image file format used to store digital images. The term bitmap comes from the computer programming terminology, meaning just a map of bits, a spatially mapped array of bits. Now, along with pixmap, it commonly refers to the similar concept of a spatially mapped array of pixels. Raster images in general may be referred to as bitmaps or pixmaps, whether synthetic or photographic, in files or memory.

Many graphical user interfaces use bitmaps in their built-in graphics subsystems; for example, the [Microsoft Windows] and [OS/2] platforms' [GDI] subsystem, where the specific format used is the Windows and OS/2 bitmap file format, usually named with the file extension of .BMP (or .DIB for device-independent bitmap). Besides BMP, other file formats that store literal bitmaps include InterLeaved Bitmap (ILBM), Portable Bitmap (PBM), X Bitmap (XBM), and Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap (WBMP). Similarly, most other image file formats, such as [JPEG], [TIFF], [PNG], and [GIF], also store bitmap images (as opposed to [vector graphics]), but they are not usually referred to as bitmaps, since they use compressed formats internally.

SpamAssassin
SpamAssassin is a computer program released under the Apache License 2.0 used for e-mail spam filtering based on content-matching rules. It is now part of the [Apache Foundation].

SpamAssassin uses a variety of spam detection techniques, that includes DNS based and fuzzy checksum based spam detection, Bayesian filtering, external programs, blacklists and online databases.

The program can be integrated with the mail server to automatically filter all mail for a site. It can also be run by individual users on their own mailbox and integrates with several mail programs. SpamAssassin is highly configurable; if used as a system wide filter it can still be configured to support per-user preferences.

SpamAssassin was awarded the Linux New Media Award 2006 as the "Best Linux-based Anti-spam Solution".

Microsoft Agent
Microsoft Agent is a technology developed by [Microsoft] which employs animated characters, text-to-speech engines, and speech recognition software to enhance interaction with computer users. Thus it is an example of an embodied agent. It comes preinstalled as part of [Microsoft Windows 2000] through [Windows Vista]. Microsoft Agent functionality is exposed as an [ActiveX] control that can be used by web pages.

The theory behind this software came from work on social interfaces by Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves at Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and Information.

Interactive character technology was first introduced in Microsoft Bob, which used an early version of Agent technology internally referred to as "Microsoft Actor." It was the code used in initial version of the Office Assistant in [Office 97]. Microsoft Agent was subsequently created by Tandy Trower in an attempt to offer technology that was more flexible and available to third-party developers to include in their applications and web pages. The software release also included four interactive characters as well as a utility that enables developers to assemble their own characters and interactions.

Microsoft Agent replaced the original Microsoft Bob code in [Office 2000], although this use did not include Agent's much-touted speech synthesis or recognition capabilities or any of the four Microsoft Agent characters. Instead the Office team created their own characters including one dubbed "Clippit" or "Clippy". However, Bob Actors or Office 97 assistants are incompatible with Office 2000 and later versions, and vice versa. The current version of Microsoft Agent was quietly released on [MSDN] in 1998. Microsoft recently announced that "Microsoft has decided to discontinue development of Microsoft Agent technologies. Beginning with [Windows 7], Microsoft Agent will not be included or supported in future versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. We encourage Microsoft Agent application developers and redistributes to evaluate their activities in light of this decision". Microsoft is no longer offering licenses and no longer distributes the SDK. (Due to customer feedback, Microsoft has decided to provide an installation package of the Microsoft Agent core components for use on Windows 7).

Microsoft Agent characters are stored in files of the .ACS extension, and can be stored in a number of compressed .ACF files for better [World Wide Web] distribution. Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Bob Actor characters are stored in files of the .ACT extension.

The speech engine itself is driven by the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), version 4 and above. Microsoft SAPI provides a control panel for easily installing and switching between various available Text to Speech and Speech to Text engines, as well as voice training and scoring systems to improve the quality and accuracy of both engines.

Microsoft provides four agent characters for free, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft Agent website. These are called Peedy, Merlin, Genie, and Robby. Some characters also shipped with Microsoft Office up to version 2003 as the Office Assistants and with [Windows XP] as search assistants. New Agent characters can also be created using Microsoft's development tools, including the Agent Character Editor. Agents can be embedded in software with [Visual Basic for Applications] and in web pages with [VBScript], and automated tools for the purpose of simplifying this exist. However, web page agents are only compatible with [Internet Explorer], since alternative browsers like [Opera] or [Mozilla Firefox] do not support [ActiveX]. Additionally, users of [Windows Me], [Windows 2000], [Windows XP], and above or owners of [Microsoft Office 2000] and up are the only ones who have Agent software pre-loaded on their computers; others have to download the software and install it manually.
